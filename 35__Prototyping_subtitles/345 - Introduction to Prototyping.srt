2
00:00:05,926 --> 00:00:07,390
 So we've talked to our users.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,780
 We've gathered some understanding of what they need.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,260
 We've created some ideas for how we might address their need and

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,580
 we've mentally simulated those different alternatives.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,050
 Now it's time to start actually making things we can put in front of users.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,585
 [SOUND] This is the prototyping stage.

8
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:25,015
 Like brainstorming design alternatives, this involves looking at the different

9
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:27,600
 ideas available to us and developing them a bit.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,170
 But the major distinction is that in prototyping,

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,350
 we want to actually build things we can put in front of users.

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,900
 But that doesn't mean building the entire interface before we

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,050
 ever even have a user look at it.

14
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,740
 We want to get user feedback as quickly and rapidly as possible.

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,520
 And build up more sophisticated prototypes over time

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,000
 as we go through the design life cycle.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,668
 So we'll start with low fidelity prototypes, things that can be assembled

18
00:00:50,668 --> 00:00:53,429
 and revised very quickly for rapid feedback from users.

19
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:57,273
 Then we'll work our way towards higher fidelity prototypes, like wire frames or

20
00:00:57,273 --> 00:00:57,273
 working versions of our interface.
