1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,730
 In this lesson we've covered various different methods for prototyping.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,910
 Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,684
 So let's start to wrap up the lesson by exploring this with another exercise.

4
00:00:10,684 --> 00:00:12,587
 Here are the methods that we've covered and

5
00:00:12,587 --> 00:00:14,920
 here are some of the potential advantages.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,955
 For each row, mark the column to which that advantage applies.

7
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:20,910
 Note that as always, these are somewhat relative,

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:20,910
 so your answer might differ from ours.
