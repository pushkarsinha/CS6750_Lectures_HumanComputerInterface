1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,105
 At the very simplest, we have verbal prototypes.

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:06,645
 That means we're literally just describing the design we have in mind to our user.

3
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:09,630
 That's probably the lowest fidelity prototype possible.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,455
 It's literally just telling the user the same thing we tell our co-designers.

5
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:15,360
 So, it's extremely easy to do,

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,835
 although it can be hard to do effectively.

7
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:21,720
 Social desirability bias is big here because it's difficult to describe

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,025
 our idea in a way that allows the participant to feel comfortable disagreeing with us.

9
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:29,760
 So, we need to make sure to ask for specific and critical feedback.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,130
 At the same time though, how do we really

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,915
 know that the user understands the design we're describing?

12
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:38,340
 We're working toward becoming experts in the areas which we're designing,

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,820
 and we don't want to fall victim to extra blind spot

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,520
 by assuming our explanation makes sense to a novice.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,155
 For that reason, analogies can be powerful tools for explaining prototypes.

16
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:51,750
 Describe your interface in terms of other tools a user might already know about.

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,040
 So, for example, imagine I was pitching the idea of Instacart,

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,540
 a grocery delivery company.

19
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,190
 I might have described it like it's like Uber for groceries.

20
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,890
 Uber is a service like taxis,

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,340
 and Instacart is like a taxi for groceries.

22
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,810
 That way of describing it in terms of an analogy to another interface can be

23
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:08,810
 a powerful way of helping your participant understand your idea more quickly.
