1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,000
 At this point,

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,980
 there's a risk of a major misconception that we should cut off right now.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,420
 We started with need finding, then develop some design alternatives, and

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,620
 now we're prototyping.

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,530
 We've talked about how prototyping follows a timeline to low fidelity

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,940
 to high fidelity prototypes, from early to late prototyping.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,300
 We might think that we move on to evaluation when we're done prototyping.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,960
 That's not the way the design life cycle works though.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,830
 We go through this cycle several times for a single design and

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,650
 a single prototype corresponds to a single iteration through the cycle.

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,990
 So we did some initial needfinding, we brainstormed some alternatives, and

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,410
 we prototyped those alternatives on paper.

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,380
 We don't jump straight from doing them on paper to doing them via wire framing

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,970
 or doing a functional prototype.

15
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,860
 We take those prototypes and we use them for evaluation.

16
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,160
 We evaluate those paper prototypes with real people.

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,300
 The results of that evaluation tell us if we need to go back and

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,410
 understand the task even better.

19
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,150
 Those results help us reflect on our alternatives as a whole,

20
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,210
 maybe come up with some new ones.

21
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,120
 Then, equipped with the results of that evaluation, that additional needfinding,

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,240
 and that additional brainstorming, we return to the prototyping phase.

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,180
 If our prototype seemed to be pretty successful and

24
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,970
 pretty sound, then maybe it's time to raise the fidelity of it.

25
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,060
 Maybe we take it from a paper prototype and actually do some wire frames, or

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,900
 do a car prototype around the actual interaction.

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,310
 If it wasn't very successful though,

28
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,830
 when we reach back here, we're going to do a different paper prototype, or

29
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,780
 a different low fidelity prototype, and then go to evaluation again.

30
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,720
 Each time we develop a new prototype we go through the same cycle again.

31
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,170
 Now that might sound extremely slow and

32
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,330
 deliberate but we also go through this on a very different time scales too.

33
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,270
 So for example, after we've gone through needfinding and

34
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,740
 designing alternative brainstorming, we can develop a paper prototype.

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,090
 We give it to a user and get their evaluation.

36
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,580
 They say that they don't like it.

37
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,390
 We ask them why,

38
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,900
 we ask them to describe what about their task isn't supported by that interface.

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,150
 That's in some ways another needfinding stage.

40
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,430
 Then we brainstorm real quick how we could resolve that.

41
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,980
 Maybe we just do that while we're sitting with that user and

42
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,610
 think it didn't support this element of what they described, but I could add

43
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,340
 that pretty quickly just by making this button or this function more visible.

44
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,350
 Now we very quickly have a new prototyping just by sketching out that

45
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,669
 addition to that paper prototype and now we can do it again.

46
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,360
 This cycle could take one minute.

47
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,430
 We could take one prototype, put it in front of a user, get their evaluation,

48
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,720
 figure out what they liked and didn't like, brainstorm a way to fix that, and

49
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,310
 then immediately revise it and try it again.

50
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,940
 We can go through this very, very quickly.

51
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,510
 We could also go through this very slowly,

52
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,200
 we could have prototypes that take months to develop.

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,220
 And generally that's why we only want to do that after we've gone through

54
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,550
 the cycle a few times.

55
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,510
 Because if we're going to take months to develop a prototype, we want to

56
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,570
 make sure we're probably going to get some pretty good evaluations on it.

57
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,530
 And we can make sure of that by prototyping the elements in lower

58
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:40,530
 fidelity first.
