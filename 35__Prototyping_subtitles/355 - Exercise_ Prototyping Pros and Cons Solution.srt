1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,490
 So here are my answers.

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,900
 First when we're talking about things that are revisable during interaction,

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,680
 we're talking about things that I as the experimenter can get

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,970
 feedback from my user and immediately change my prototype.

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,160
 So if they say that that button label doesn't really makes sense,

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,800
 I can cross out that button label and immediately change it.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,720
 That makes sense for prototypes that are very low fidelity.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,670
 Verbal prototypes, I can immediately say okay,

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,730
 then let's make it the way you just described.

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,230
 Paper prototypes or card prototypes, I could quickly erase or

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,050
 cross out something on my prototype and change it.

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,010
 Wizard of Oz is similar.

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,160
 Since I'm running what's going on behind the scenes,

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,400
 I can just change the way I'm running it.

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,350
 Those four prototypes,

16
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,380
 because they're more low fidelity, also disguises superficial details.

17
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,120
 No one is going to look at a prototype that I drew by hand and

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,690
 say they don't like the font.

19
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,020
 No one is going to to listen to me run a Wizard of Oz prototype for

20
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,030
 a voice interface and say, I don't like the voice that you're using.

21
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,950
 These help us focus on the overall patterns of interaction and

22
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,140
 disguise some of the superficial elements that users would often have

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,800
 a tendency to get distracted by.

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,110
 However, as we prototype,

25
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,880
 we need to move from designing interfaces to designing interactions.

26
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,709
 Verbal prototypes and paper prototypes don't really cover interactions,

27
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,000
 they cover showing something and asking the user what they think,

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,620
 but they don't really go further than that.

29
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,280
 Card prototypes,

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,440
 Wizard of Oz prototypes, to a certain extent wireframing and to a certain

31
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,010
 extent physical prototypes all let us actually simulate the user interaction.

32
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,430
 With a card prototype, we're actually saying if you did that,

33
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,900
 then you would see this, so they can walk through the pattern of interaction.

34
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,190
 Wizard of Oz, we can simply call out or describe or

35
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,210
 simulate, this is what would happen if you do what you just described.

36
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,005
 Now, wifeframing you could do more like a paper prototype, where it's just

37
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:36,775
 a simple wire frame, but more generally, we use wire frames when we're ready to

38
00:01:36,775 --> 00:01:40,695
 actually show different interfaces and the movement between them.

39
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:41,995
 Similarly with physical prototypes,

40
00:01:41,995 --> 00:01:45,565
 the main reason why we would do a physical prototype is to hand a user,

41
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:49,225
 and say, pretend you're jogging, or pretend you're working in your office.

42
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:51,110
 How would this interact with what you're actually doing?

43
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,630
 We're simulating the way they would physically use it.

44
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,580
 Now among all of these, the wires frames are really the ones that are most

45
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,800
 easily distributable to remote users.

46
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,200
 You can make an argument that we can send scans for a paper prototypes but

47
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,180
 generally, a paper prototype isn't just about what's on paper.

48
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,794
 It's also about the conversations and descriptions that we're having around it

49
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:12,345
 and asking users what they think about certain elements.

50
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:16,295
 Whereas a wire frame is more about a general impression that users get.

51
00:02:16,295 --> 00:02:19,545
 You can make the argument that paper prototypes can be sent easily, as well.

52
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:23,485
 But for me, I would only share wire frames with remote users.

53
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:27,190
 Now prototyping look and feel is really just the inverse of disguise and

54
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,660
 superficial details.

55
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,710
 Look and feel is really about those superficial elements that have

56
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,090
 a significant user impact, but are more easily modifiable within an overall

57
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,390
 pattern of functional interaction.

58
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,940
 So just as the earlier low fidelity prototypes support disguising details,

59
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,310
 the later ones support prototyping look and feel.

60
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,990
 As computers become more ubiquitous, and

61
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,680
 users are moving around while interacting with interfaces more and

62
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,680
 more, allowing mobility is really valuable.

63
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,700
 Wizard of Oz, since we're just calling things out to the user,

64
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,260
 let them move around, and same with physical prototypes.

65
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,154
 We can actually hand them to a user and have them physically interact,

66
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:01,154
 the way they would with the actual interface
