00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,850
 There's one other misconception that I've seen in some designers

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,560
 I've worked with that I feel is also worth explicitly acknowledging.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,620
 All your prototypes don't have to be at the same level, at the same time.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,420
 Take Facebook for example.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,480
 Facebook is a complete app already implemented.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,880
 Imagine that Facebook wanted to redesign their status update box, which

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,790
 they've done pretty recently and have probably done since I recorded this.

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,400
 Just because the interface is complete in other ways doesn't mean that

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,310
 all future prototyping efforts need to be similarly high fidelity.

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,910
 They don't need to implement an entire new status composition screen

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,350
 just to prototype it.

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,230
 They can prototype it in lower fidelity with sketches, or wire frames, put that

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,500
 in front of users, get their feedback, before ever actually implementing it

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,820
 into a functional prototype or a working part of the website.

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,360
 This applies particularly strongly to the design of apps or

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,420
 programs with multiple functions.

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,328
 So take something like the LinkedIn app.

18
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:55,484
 It has a number of different functions like editing your own profile, or

19
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:58,170
 connecting with others, or browsing your news feed.

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,920
 Each of these individual screens has its own tasks and interactions.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,930
 And moving amongst them, is itself a task or a type of interaction.

22
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,920
 Trying to design all the screens and

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,100
 the transitions among them all at the same time is likely far too much.

24
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,960
 So we could take the bottom-up approach, where we would design the individual

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,210
 screens first, and then design the app experience as a whole.

26
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,580
 Or we might take the top-down approach and

27
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,300
 design the overall experience of moving between these different screens, and

28
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,690
 then design the contents of the individual screens.

29
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,890
 The point of this is that at any time, protoyping can and

30
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:30,890
 should exist at multiple levels of fidelity.
