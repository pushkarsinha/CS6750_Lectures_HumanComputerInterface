00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,375
 Paper prototyping involve drawing things simply on paper,

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:05,730
 and it can be really good for experimenting with overall layouts,

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,860
 especially because it tends to be a lot easier

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,605
 to revise and tweak those pretty naturally.

5
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:12,270
 After some feedback though,

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,345
 you'll likely want to start formalizing your designs a little bit more.

7
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:18,015
 One way of doing this would be called wireframing.

8
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:19,980
 In wireframing, we use

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,580
 some more detailed tools to mark up what an interface might look like.

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,500
 For example, my paper prototype from earlier might become a wireframe like this.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,890
 This lets us experiment with some additional details like font size,

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,860
 colors, and the challenges of screen real estate.

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,280
 Now, there are lots of tools out there for wireframing that

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,890
 come equipped with built-in common widgets and layouts.

15
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,510
 But you can also do some rudimentary wireframing in something as simple as PowerPoint.

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,050
 Google Drawings can be used the same way as well.

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,770
 So, you don't need to get super fancy.

18
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,615
 Although if you do a lot of wireframing,

19
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:53,240
 you're probably want to find a more streamlined tool.

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,240
 Some of the more popular paid products include Balsamiq and Axure.

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,829
 These are both targeted more at professionals

22
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,410
 working in user interface or user experience design,

23
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,385
 especially on teams and collaborating with a lot of people.

24
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:10,130
 If you're familiar with the suites of tools from either Microsoft or Adobe,

25
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,890
 then Visio or InDesign might also be great options for you to use,

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,940
 because you're already somewhat familiar with those interfaces.

27
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,230
 But you don't actually have to buy a tool to do good wireframing.

28
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,490
 There exists some free to use tools out there as well,

29
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,700
 like the pencil project and frame box.

30
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,915
 Those are great to use, especially if you're just getting started.

31
00:01:28,915 --> 00:01:33,065
 Of course., these are just the popular ones that I know about right now.

32
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:35,960
 There are almost certainly more out there that I'm not familiar with,

33
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,850
 and more will surely come available.

34
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,045
 So, check with your classmates or colleagues to see what they would recommend.

35
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:43,970
 I'm personally really excited to see what kind of prototyping options

36
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,120
 emerge for areas like virtual reality and augmented reality,

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,120
 where you can't really prototype on a 2D canvas like this.
