1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
 One step above just describing our ideas to our user

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,880
 in a verbal prototype would be actually drawing them out.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,085
 This is what we call a "Paper prototype."

4
00:00:08,085 --> 00:00:09,780
 We could do this for anything, from designing

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,140
 an on-screen interface to designing the placement of controls in a vehicle.

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,495
 Let's go back to our example of designing away for

7
00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:18,435
 exercisers to consume and take notes on audio books.

8
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:22,140
 Let's imagine one of my design alternatives was for a very easy to use app,

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,150
 so that the hassle of pulling out your phone

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,475
 and pressing buttons isn't actually too distracting.

11
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:30,645
 I might start this process simply by drawing a prototype of my interface on paper.

12
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:41,970
 Now I have a paper prototype.

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,230
 Now, I can talk to my user,

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,715
 and I could ask her thoughts about it.

15
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:51,320
 We'll talk about the kinds of thoughts I'll ask about when we talk about evaluation,

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,910
 but generally, I can say, "Hey,

17
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,195
 Morgan, what do you think about this design?"

18
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:58,260
 Looks pretty good. Straight forward. There's play.

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,055
 There's fast-forward.

20
00:01:00,055 --> 00:01:04,490
 I would like a way to see where I am in the book, though.

21
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,060
 That makes sense. Notice that she didn't comment on color,

22
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,545
 or font or anything like that,

23
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:10,780
 not because I said, "Hey,

24
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,470
 I'm ignoring font right now," but because

25
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,395
 it's pretty obvious I'm not really caring about font right now.

26
00:01:15,395 --> 00:01:17,330
 The nature of the paper prototype is it tells

27
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,220
 the user what kind of feedback we're looking for.

28
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,935
 We're looking for pretty basic layout information.

29
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:23,510
 Now, because this is on paper,

30
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,040
 I can actually immediately revise

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,410
 my prototype and incorporate the things that she suggested.

32
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,320
 Now, I have a revision based on her feedback,

33
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,500
 and I can ask, "Hey, how's that?"

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,930
 Looks great, David.

35
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,920
 Thank you. Now, paper prototyping isn't only

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,100
 useful for testing out just single interface designs.

37
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,900
 You can also do some interaction with it.

38
00:01:44,900 --> 00:02:18,350
 Watch.

39
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,470
 So, here I have four screens prototyped.

40
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,900
 So, when I give this to Morgan,

41
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,255
 and I can say things like,

42
00:02:25,255 --> 00:02:28,040
 imagine you're viewing the screen and you want to take

43
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,315
 a note to attach to your current place in the book, what would you probably do?

44
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:34,425
 Probably press the view their notes button.

45
00:02:34,425 --> 00:02:36,790
 That makes sense. After you press that,

46
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:43,130
 what you're going to see is this screen for note-taking. So, what would you do then?

47
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,640
 Well, if I want to take a note,

48
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,855
 then I would press the record button there.

49
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:50,180
 Yes. Exactly. Then it would start recording you.

50
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,380
 It would transcribe what you say,

51
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,305
 and then at the end you'd press stop to continue.

52
00:02:54,305 --> 00:02:56,630
 So interestingly, just doing this,

53
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,790
 I've already noticed that there's really no reason to make

54
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,220
 her jump to a separate note-taking screen,

55
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,680
 which you want to take a note while listening.

56
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,510
 It should actually just be a note-taking button here on the main screen.

57
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,340
 So, just like this, I could walk through some interaction with the app

58
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,340
 on paper and and get some ideas like that about how I can improve it.

59
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,915
 This is also called card-based prototyping.

60
00:03:15,915 --> 00:03:18,650
 The idea is each screen is on a different card,

61
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,960
 and I can quickly set those cards and announce so we can

62
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,410
 simulate what it would be like to use the real application.

63
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,390
 So, that way I can prototype a decent amount of the interfaces

64
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,390
 interaction with pretty low prototyping effort meat.
