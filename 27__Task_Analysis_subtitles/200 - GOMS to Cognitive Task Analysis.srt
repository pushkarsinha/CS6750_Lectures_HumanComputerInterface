00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,530
 Gomes models are human information processor models.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,600
 This method largely assumes the human is an input output machine,

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,180
 and it doesn't get too much into the internal reasoning of the human.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,740
 Instead, it distills their reasoning into things that can be described

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,290
 explicitly like goals and methods.

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,146
 Some would argue, myself included,

7
00:00:17,146 --> 00:00:21,560
 that human reasoning is actually too nuanced and complex to be so simplified.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,130
 They, or we,

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,110
 advocate other models to get more into what goes on inside the user's head.

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,730
 That's where cognitive task analysis comes in.

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,640
 Cognitive task analysis is another way of examining tasks, but it puts a much

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,430
 higher emphasis on things like memory, attention, and cognitive load.

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,880
 Thus, cognitive task analysis adopts more of the predictor view of

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:40,880
 the human's role in the system.
