1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,560
 We can take the GOMS model and apply it to a number of different domains.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,480
 So let's take the example of needing to communicate a message to a coworker.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,863
 We have an initial situation,

4
00:00:08,863 --> 00:00:11,426
 which is the need to transfer information to a coworker.

5
00:00:11,426 --> 00:00:14,545
 That carries with it the implicit goal of the information having been

6
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:15,252
 transferred.

7
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:17,240
 We might have a number of different methods in mind for

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,043
 how we could do that.

9
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:20,940
 We could email them, we could walk over and talk to them in person.

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,720
 And we also have some selection rules that dictate how we choose

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,170
 amongst these methods.

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,320
 If what we need to transfer is very time-sensitive, maybe we walk over and

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,500
 talk to them in person or call them on the phone.

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,090
 If the information we need to transfer is complex and

15
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,210
 detailed, maybe we write them an email.

16
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,630
 Or if it's more casual, maybe we chat with them or text them.

17
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,850
 No matter what method we choose,

18
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,230
 we then execute the series of operators that carries out that method, and

19
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,250
 the result is our goal is accomplished, the information has been transmitted.

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,850
 Or we could also take the problem of navigation.

21
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,332
 Our initial situation is the need to get to our destination,

22
00:00:52,332 --> 00:00:55,458
 which carries with it the implicit goal of having reached our destination.

23
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,818
 We might have different methods, like take the scenic route,

24
00:00:57,818 --> 00:01:00,890
 take the highway route, take the surface streets, and some selection rules that

25
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,294
 might say something like, when it's rush hour on the highway,

26
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:06,800
 take surface streets, or if it's not time sensitive, take the scenic route.

27
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,766
 After choosing, we execute those operators and reach our goal.

28
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:12,355
 So in this way, GOMS models capture our goals,

29
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:15,465
 our different methods for carrying out those goals, and

30
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:15,465
 the individual operators that we use to execute those methods.
