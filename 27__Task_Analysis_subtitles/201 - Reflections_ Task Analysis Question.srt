1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,630
 This conflict between more processor-oriented and

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,300
 more predictor-oriented models of the user actually gets at

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,280
 the core of an old battle in psychology between behaviorism and cognitivism.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,370
 Behaviorism emphasized things that could be observed.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,250
 We can see what input a person is receiving.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,240
 We can see the output they're producing.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,630
 And that might be all we need to understand the design of things.

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,320
 Cognitivism, on the other hand, suggests we can and

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,070
 should get into the mind of what people are actually thinking and

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,920
 how systems like memory and learning and perception actually work.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,970
 So take a moment and reflect on what you think about this.

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,111
 When designing interfaces,

13
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:37,360
 how much attention should you devote to observable goals, operators and methods?

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,063
 And how much do you devote to understanding internal thought

15
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:40,063
 processes, like cognition, learning, and memory?
