00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:08,850
 Every possible application of HCI involves users completing some sort of task.

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,250
 That task might be something within a domain.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,960
 In educational technology, for example,

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,035
 at that task might be learning how to do a certain kind of problem.

5
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:18,060
 If your area is more technological,

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,390
 the task might be something that the user is doing through your application like

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,725
 using virtual reality and gesture recognition to sculpt the virtual statue.

8
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:28,770
 Take a moment and try to think of the kinds of tasks you

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,040
 might be interested in exploring in your chosen application area.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,660
 Did they lend themselves more to an information processor model like gums,

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:35,660
 or to cognitive models like hierarchical task analysis and how can you tell?
