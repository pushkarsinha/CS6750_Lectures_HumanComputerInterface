1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,780
 GOMS and cognitive tasks analysis are just two of the many alternatives to

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,190
 understanding how users approach tasks.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,410
 More in line with the human information processor models,

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,940
 there exist models like KLM, TLM, and MHP,

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,750
 which capture even finer grain actions for estimating performance speed.

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,870
 There are other extensions to GOMS as well that add things like sub goals, or

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,940
 other ways of expressing content like CPM-GOMS and NGOMSL.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,930
 CPM-GOMS focuses on parallel tasks, while NGOMSL

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,360
 provides a natural language interface for interacting with GOMS models.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,647
 More on the lines of cognitive models,

11
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:36,973
 there exists other methods as well like CDM, TKS, CFM,

12
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:42,260
 Applied Cognitive Task Analyses, and Skill-Based Cognitive Task Analyses.

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,830
 CDM puts a focus on places where critical decisions occur.

14
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,380
 TKS focuses on the nature of humans' knowledge.

15
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,566
 CFM focuses on complexity.

16
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:54,780
 ACTA and Skill-Based CTA are two ways of

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,420
 gathering the information necessary to create a cognitive model.

18
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,612
 There also exists other frameworks more common in other disciplines, for

19
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:04,819
 example, production systems are common to an artificial intelligence.

20
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,910
 But they're intended to model cognitive systems the same way these cognitive

21
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,910
 models do.

22
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,960
 So we can apply production systems here as well and

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:10,960
 attempt to prescribe rules for users to follow.
