00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,380
 The GOMS model is a human information processor model so

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,880
 it builds off the processor model of the human's role in a system.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,830
 The GOMS model gets it's name from the four sets of information it

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,910
 proposes gathering about a task.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,640
 G, stands for the users Goals in the system.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,200
 O, stands for the Operators the user can perform in the system.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,520
 M stands for the Methods that the user can use to achieve those goals.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,270
 And S stands for the Selection rules that the user uses to choose among

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,030
 different competing methods.

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,160
 So the GOMS Model proposes that every human interact with the system

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,840
 has a set of Goals that they want to accomplish.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,570
 They have sent methods that they can choose from to accomplish those goals.

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,390
 Each of those methods is comprise of a series of Operators that carries

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,000
 out that method.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,690
 And they have some Selection rules that help them decide what method to

16
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,970
 use and when.

17
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,660
 The GOMS model is often visualized like this.

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,620
 The user starts with some initial situation, and they have a goal

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,910
 in mind that they want to accomplish, so they apply their selection of rule to

20
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,540
 choice between different competing methods to accomplish that goal.

21
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,340
 Once they've chosen a method, they execute that series of operators and

22
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:58,340
 makes that goal a reality
