1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,793
 Just like Goms models, cognitive task analysis also have some strength and

2
00:00:03,793 --> 00:00:05,120
 some weaknesses.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,140
 One strength is that they emphasize mental processes.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,220
 Unlike the Goms model,

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,520
 cognitive task analysis puts an emphasis on what goes on inside the users head.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,480
 It's thus much better equipped to understand how experts think and work.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,420
 The information it generated is also formal enough to be used for

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,820
 interface design, for comparison in mode alternatives and more.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,630
 There are disadvantages though.

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,480
 One, cogni-task analysis are incredibly time-consuming to perform.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,260
 They involve talking to multiple experts for

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,020
 extended period of time, then systematically analyzing the data.

13
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,030
 A second weakness is that cogni-task analysis risk deemphasizing context.

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,846
 In zooming in on the individual's own thought processes,

15
00:00:42,846 --> 00:00:47,500
 cogni-task analysis risks deemphasizing details that are out in the world.

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,392
 Like the role of physical capabilities or

17
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:52,534
 interactions amongst different people, or different artifacts.

18
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:53,244
 And third,

19
00:00:53,244 --> 00:00:57,934
 like Goms models, cogni-task analysis also isn't well suited to novices.

20
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:00,949
 It's well suited to expert users who have very strong models of the way

21
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:04,340
 they work and clearly understand their own mental thought processes.

22
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,730
 But they're not very well suited for

23
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:05,730
 novice users who are still trying to learn how to use an interface.
