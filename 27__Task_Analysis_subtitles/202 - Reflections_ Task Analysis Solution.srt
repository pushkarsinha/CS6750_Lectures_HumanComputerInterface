00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,380
 You can probably guess my bias on this issue, given that I've already

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,200
 badmouthed the processor model and I also teach cognitive systems.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,100
 So I'm generally going to prefer methods that focus on cognition.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,380
 I think it's important to note here though that both approaches have

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,030
 significant value.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,610
 The GOMS model and its emphasis on identifying goals and

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,170
 operators is actually very useful in HCI.

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,310
 Because it forces us to very clearly and deliberately identify user goals and

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,670
 the sequence of actions that accomplish them.

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,710
 We can get so caught up in user experiences that we forget the user

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,390
 experience is born out of individual operators.

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,680
 So while I wouldn't advocate focusing solely on the user as some kind of input

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,900
 output information processor, there's value in defining the user's operation

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:40,900
 as clearly and specifically as we define a computer's.
