1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,410
 What we saw here was that to get inside and

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,870
 disable the alarm, there was a sequence of actions that had to be completed,

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,680
 but some of them could be completed in different orders.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,301
 If she used the keypad, she had to first unlock the door and then open the door.

5
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:15,418
 Then she could either disable the alarm on the keypad or close the door.

6
00:00:15,418 --> 00:00:17,819
 And after closing the door, she could re-lock the door,

7
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:20,230
 though she could also do that before disarming the alarm.

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,430
 So there's some choices there.

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,810
 With the keychain, the sequence of tasks related to the door remain the same, but

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,910
 she had the option of disarming the alarm before even entering.

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,600
 However, that required remembering to do so.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,210
 When using the keypad, she didn't have to remember because the alarm beeps at

13
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,790
 her until she turns it off.

14
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,970
 But she has to remember the key code.

15
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,290
 Performing these cognitive task analyses gives us the information necessary to

16
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,750
 evaluate different approaches and look for areas of improvement.

17
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,530
 For example, if she can disable the alarm just by pressing the keychain

18
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,090
 button, why does she need to press it at all?

19
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:50,090
 Why doesn't it just detect that she's coming in with a keychain in her pocket?
