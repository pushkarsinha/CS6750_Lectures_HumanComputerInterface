00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,910
 Here's one example of how you might design a GOMS model for

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,760
 disabling a security system.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,750
 Our initial situation is that we're entering the home with the alarm set and

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,370
 we have two methods for disabling the alarm.

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,170
 We can use the keypad or we can use the keychain.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,378
 Either way, our goal is that we've entered the home and

7
00:00:16,378 --> 00:00:17,780
 reenabled the alarm.

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,294
 Our selection rules might be something like if we have our hands full,

9
00:00:20,294 --> 00:00:23,380
 we're going to use the keypad so that we can get inside and put the stuff down.

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,800
 But if we don't have our hands full, we'll use the keychain.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,590
 You might come up with other models for this that have either different methods,

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,830
 different operators, different selection rules.

13
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,890
 There are a lot of different ways we can capture a task with the GOMS model,

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:33,890
 depending on what you choose to focus on.
