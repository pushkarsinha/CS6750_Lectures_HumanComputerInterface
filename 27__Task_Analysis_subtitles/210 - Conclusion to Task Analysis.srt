00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,445
 Today, we've talked at length about two general methods for approaching task analysis.

2
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:13,080
 One, the GOMS family of approaches tries to distill tasks down to their goals,

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,615
 operators, methods, and selection rules.

4
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:18,135
 The other, cognitive task analysis

5
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:20,930
 aimed to get into the head of the user and understand what they're thinking,

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,075
 feeling, and remembering at every stage of the task.

7
00:00:24,075 --> 00:00:25,980
 When we discussed design life-cycles,

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,755
 we focused a bit on how to fill these miles with information.

9
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:30,930
 But our focus there is on the methods for gathering

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,660
 the information rather than the structure of the information itself.

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:33,660
 So, it's important to keep these methods in mind when we talk about that.
