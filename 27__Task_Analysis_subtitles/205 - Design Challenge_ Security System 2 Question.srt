00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,000
 Let's watch the videos of Morgan disabling her security system again.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,689
 This time though,

3
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:09,140
 let's try to approach this from a more cognitive task analysis perspective.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,970
 We won't be able to do that fully, because doing a full cognitive task

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,920
 analysis means interviewing, asking the user to think out loud, and more.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,600
 But we can at least try out this approach.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,600
 Remember, in doing a cognitive task analysis for

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,720
 a task like this, your goal is to build a model of the sequence of

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,060
 thoughts going on inside the user's head.

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,844
 Pay special attention to what she needs to remember at each step of the process.
