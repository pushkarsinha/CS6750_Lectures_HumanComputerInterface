00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,099
 When looking at human computer interaction,

2
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,025
 we're really looking at the tasks that users perform.

3
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:13,529
 We look at the tasks that they're performing now,

4
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:17,520
 and we try to restructure those tasks to be more efficient using new interfaces.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,690
 In all of this, the task is at the heart of the exercise.

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,460
 What task are they performing?

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,140
 So today, we're going to talk about two methods for

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,960
 formerly articulating the tasks that people are completing.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,170
 First, we'll discuss human information processor models.

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,595
 Especially, the Goleman's model,

11
00:00:32,595 --> 00:00:34,625
 which focuses on the input to the user,

12
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,295
 and the output from the user.

13
00:00:36,295 --> 00:00:40,315
 Now, this is similar to the process or model of the user that we discussed elsewhere.

14
00:00:40,315 --> 00:00:43,310
 Second, we'll discuss cognitive task analysis,

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,470
 a way of trying to get inside the user's head,

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,080
 instead of focusing just on the input and the output.

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,030
 Note that that's similar to the predictor model

18
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:50,030
 of the user that we also discussed elsewhere.
