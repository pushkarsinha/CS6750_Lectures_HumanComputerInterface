00:00:05,991 --> 00:00:09,500
 When we've developed a good understanding of the needs of our user,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,828
 it's time to move on to the second phase of the design life cycle,

4
00:00:12,828 --> 00:00:14,052
 design alternatives.

5
00:00:14,052 --> 00:00:16,748
 This is when we start to brainstorm how to accomplish the task we've been

6
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:18,160
 investigating.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,050
 The problem here is that design is very hard, it's hard for a number of reasons.

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,720
 The number of choices we have to make, and

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,190
 things we have to control is more expansive than ever before.

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,390
 Are we designing for desktops, laptops, tablets, smart phones,

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,160
 smart watches, augmented reality, virtual reality, 2D, 3D,

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,990
 gesture input, pen input, keyboard input, mouse input, voice input?

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,940
 In this lesson, we're going to talk about how to generate ideas for designs.

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,720
 And then we'll chat about how to explore those ideas a bit further

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:46,720
 to figure out what you want to actually pursue.
