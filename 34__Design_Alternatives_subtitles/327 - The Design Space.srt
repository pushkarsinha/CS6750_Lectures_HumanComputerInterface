1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,820
 When we talk about the problem we're solving here we define the problem space

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,170
 as disabling a security system as we enter a home.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,760
 We defined our problem as far as possible away from

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,170
 the current interfaces for doing it.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,050
 The design space on the other hand is the area

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,040
 in which we design our solutions to this problem.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,850
 The current design space for this problem is wall mounted devices and

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,120
 portable devices like my key chain.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,950
 But as we design, the space of possible ideas might expand.

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,095
 For example, as we go along we might be interested in voice interfaces or

11
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:32,130
 interfaces with our mobile phones or wearable devices.

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,600
 Our goal during the design alternative phase is to explore the possible design

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,210
 space.

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,532
 We don't want to narrow down too early by sticking devices on walls or

15
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:41,088
 devices on keychains.

16
00:00:41,088 --> 00:00:43,522
 We want to brainstorm lots of possible approaches, and

17
00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:43,522
 grow a large space of possible designs.
