00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,080
 In our unit on principles, we talk about task analysis, including things like

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,590
 cognitive task analysis or human information processor models.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,280
 Performing those analysis as part of our need finding

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,180
 also gives us a nice tool for exploring our design alternatives.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,824
 Using this, we can start to look at how exactly the goals, operators, methods,

6
00:00:18,824 --> 00:00:22,729
 and selection rules of the Gomes model map up to the ideas of our design

7
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:24,080
 alternatives.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,290
 How does the user achieve each of their goals in each interface?

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,530
 How relatively easy are the goals to achieve between the different design

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,660
 alternatives?

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,250
 With the results of our cognitive task analysis, we can start to

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,780
 ask some deeper questions about what the user is keeping in mind as well.

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,100
 Given what we know about things competing for our user's attention,

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,690
 what are the likelihoods that each interface will work?

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,640
 In some ways, this is a similar process to using personas we outlined earlier,

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,400
 but with a subtle difference.

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,770
 Personas are personal and

18
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,210
 meant to give us an empathetic view of the user experience.

19
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,630
 User models are more objective and meant to give us a measurable and

20
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,680
 comparable view of the user experience.

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,069
 So ideally, the result of this kind of analysis is we would be able to say that

22
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,090
 the different alternatives have these different phases and these different

23
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,140
 phases have different efficiencies or different speeds associated with them.

24
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,605
 So, we could start to say exactly how efficient one design is compared

25
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:15,605
 to another.
