1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,870
 The brainstorming process should lead you to a list of

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,810
 bunch of high level general design alternatives.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,620
 These are likely just a few words or a sentence each but

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,460
 they described some very general idea of how you might design the interface,

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,540
 to accomplish this task.

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,580
 Your next step is to try to flush these ideas out into three or

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,720
 four ideas that are worth taking forward to the prototyping stage.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,000
 Some of the ideas you might be able to dismiss pretty quickly,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,100
 that's all right.

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,520
 You can't generate good ideas without generating a lot of ideas.

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,970
 Even though you won't end up using all of them.

12
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,420
 In other places, you might explore an idea a little before dismissing it or

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,720
 you might combine two ideas into a new idea.

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,960
 In the rest of this lesson,

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,330
 we'll give you some thought experiments you can use to evaluate these ideas and

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:42,330
 decide what to keep, what to combine and what to dismiss.
