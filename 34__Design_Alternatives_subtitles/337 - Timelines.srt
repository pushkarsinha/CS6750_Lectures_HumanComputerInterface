1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,689
 Building on the idea of a persona we can take that person and stretch her out

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:08,880
 over time and see what is she thinking, what is she doing at various stages of

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,310
 interacting with our interface or interacting with the task at hand.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,890
 I've also heard this called journey maps although

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,680
 journey maps usually cover much longer periods of time.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,100
 They cover the entire expanse of the persons life,

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,930
 why they are interested in something and where they are going from here.

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,860
 Timelines can be more narrowed to the specific time which

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,410
 users are interacting with the task or with the program.

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,140
 So our goal is to take that persona and stretched it out overtime.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,060
 So for our example, what sparks Anika to decide to exercise in the first place?

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,450
 That might be really useful information to know.

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,730
 After she decided to exercise, what did she do next?

14
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,630
 In theory she doesn't just start right there.

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,330
 She goes exercise somewhere she has kind of setup process.

16
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,240
 Then what does she do?

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,200
 In this case, maybe she set ups her audiobooks as she actually pushes play,

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,530
 puts her headphones in, and so on.

19
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,520
 And then there's probably a period of actual exercise in our example,

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,970
 and then at the end, she turns off the audiobook.

21
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,860
 The usefulness of drawing this as a timeline is it starts to let

22
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,190
 us ask some pretty interesting questions.

23
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,330
 What prompts this person to actually engage in the task in the first place?

24
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,630
 What actions lead up to the task?

25
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,690
 How are they feeling at every stage of the task?

26
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,820
 And can we use that?

27
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,220
 How would each design alternative impact their experience throughout this

28
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,490
 process?

29
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,845
 For example, if our persona for

30
00:01:24,845 --> 00:01:28,220
 Anika was that she really doesn't like to exercise but she knows she really

31
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,000
 needs to, then we know her mood during this phase might be kind of glum.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,480
 We need to design our app with the understanding that she might have

33
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,210
 kind of low motivation to engage in this at all.

34
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,530
 If our app is a little bit frustrating to use,

35
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,220
 then it might turn her off of exercising all together.

36
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,100
 On the other hand, if Anika really likes to exercise,

37
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,840
 then maybe she's in a very good mood during this phase.

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,230
 And if she likes exercising on its own,

39
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,050
 maybe she forgets to even set up the audio book at all.

40
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,060
 So then we need to design our app with that in mind.

41
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,060
 We need to design it such that there's something built into it that could maybe

42
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,480
 remind her that when she gets to a certain location,

43
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,390
 she meant to start her audio book.

44
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,160
 So stretching this out as a timeline lets us explore not only

45
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,160
 who the user is, but also what they're thinking and what they're feeling.

46
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,110
 And how what we design can integrate with a task that they're

47
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,660
 participating in.

48
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,540
 Exploring our different design alternatives in this way

49
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,960
 allows us to start to gauge which designs might have the greatest

50
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,920
 potential to positively impact the user's experience.

51
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,300
 And they also let us explore what might be different between different users.

52
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,000
 Our design might need to be different for Anika who loves to exercise, and

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,370
 Paul who hates exercising.

54
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:35,370
 This timeline let's us start to explore those more personal elements.
