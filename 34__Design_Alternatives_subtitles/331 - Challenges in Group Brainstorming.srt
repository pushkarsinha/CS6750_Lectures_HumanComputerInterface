00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,150
 Group brain storming presents some significant issues.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,280
 Thompson in 2008 laid out four behaviors in group brainstorming that can block

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,730
 progress.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,170
 The first is social loafing.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,590
 People often don't tend to work as hard in groups as they would individually.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,410
 It's easy to feel like the responsibility for

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,790
 unproductive brainstorming is shared and deflected.

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,810
 In individual brainstorming, it's clearly on the individual.

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,760
 The second blocker is conformity, people in groups tend to want to agree.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,702
 Studies have shown that

11
00:00:29,702 --> 00:00:31,828
 group brainstorming leads to convergent thinking.

12
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:35,855
 The conversation the group has tends to force participants down the same line of

13
00:00:35,855 --> 00:00:37,539
 thinking, generating fewer and

14
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:41,230
 less varied ideas than the individuals acting alone.

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,090
 During brainstorming,

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,720
 though, the goal is diversion thinking, lots of ideas, lots of creativity.

17
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,774
 The third blocker is production blocking.

18
00:00:48,774 --> 00:00:52,300
 In group brainstorming, there are often individuals who dominate

19
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,840
 the conversation and make it difficult for others to actually be heard.

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,930
 Their ideas can thus command more weight, not because of the strength of

21
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,370
 the ideas, but because of the volume of the description.

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,970
 The fourth blocker is performance matching.

23
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,986
 People tend to converge in terms of passion and performance,

24
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:10,248
 which can lead to a loss of momentum over time.

25
00:01:10,248 --> 00:01:13,916
 That might be able to get people excited if they're around other excited people

26
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:14,682
 initially, but

27
00:01:14,682 --> 00:01:19,360
 more often than not, it saps the energy of those who enter with enthusiasm.

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,240
 In addition to these four challenges, I would add a fifth.

29
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,290
 Group brainstorming may also be prone to power dynamics, or biases.

30
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,140
 No matter how supportive and collaborative a boss might be,

31
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,960
 there'll likely always exist a tacit pressure to build on her suggestions,

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,490
 which dampens creative brainstorming.

33
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,400
 There also exists considerable literature stating that other biases

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,400
 based on gender, age, race, complain to these group sessions as well.

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,910
 Now note that this doesn't mean group brainstorming should be avoided

36
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,145
 altogether.

37
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:50,505
 What it means is that we should enter into group brainstorming with strong

38
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:53,255
 ideas of how to address these issues, ideally,

39
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:53,255
 after a phase of individual brainstorming has already occurred.
