1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,274
 We can create general timelines for routine interactions with our design alternatives,

2
00:00:04,274 --> 00:00:06,600
 but it's often even more interesting to examine

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,425
 the specific scenarios users will encounter while using our interfaces.

4
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:13,410
 Rather than outlining the whole course of interaction,

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,690
 scenarios let us discuss specific kinds of

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,735
 interactions and events that we want to be able to handle.

7
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:21,495
 This is sometimes also referred to as storyboards,

8
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:26,220
 sequences of diagrams or drawings to outline what happens in a particular scenario.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,869
 The difference between timelines,

10
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,235
 and storyboards, and scenarios,

11
00:00:29,235 --> 00:00:32,100
 is that timelines, in my experience at least,

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,600
 tend to be pretty general.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,270
 They're how a routine interaction with the interface or

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,110
 routine interaction with the design alternative goes.

15
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,730
 Scenarios and storyboards are more specific.

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,180
 They are about a particular person interacting in

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,435
 a particular way with particular events coming up.

18
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:49,960
 So, let's build one of these scenarios.

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,460
 Morgan is out jogging when a fire engine goes by.

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,165
 It's so loud that she misses about 30 seconds of the book.

21
00:00:57,165 --> 00:00:58,850
 How did she recover from this?

22
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,495
 What we want to go through that question with each of our different design alternatives?

23
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:03,980
 For our touch interface,

24
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,130
 she would need to stop,

25
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,340
 pull out her phone, turn on the screen, and pause the book.

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,940
 For our voice interface,

27
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,675
 she would have to wait for the fire engine to finish passing and then say, "Rewind."

28
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:16,730
 Because chances are, if it's too loud for her to hear her book,

29
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,090
 it's probably too loud for her phone to hear her voice command.

30
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,025
 But for a gestural interface,

31
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:24,950
 she could simply make the gesture that will allow her to pause the book,

32
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,775
 and then play again when the fire engine has finished passing.

33
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:30,680
 Ideally, we'd like to outline several such scenarios and

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,590
 explore them for various personas and design alternatives.

35
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,705
 Of course, now, we're reaching three degrees of freedom,

36
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:40,220
 so it's not crucial that we explore every possible combination of persona,

37
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,110
 scenario, and design alternative.

38
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,600
 This is a more fluid process of exploring,

39
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,130
 what ideas have potential,

40
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,180
 and what ideas are worth exploring further?

41
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,910
 We might find there are certain combinations of

42
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,325
 scenarios and personas that we really care about,

43
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:54,800
 that completely rule out certain design alternatives.

44
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,980
 If we really care about allowing her to exercise in a loud area,

45
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,435
 that goes ahead and tells us that

46
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:02,560
 a voice interface might not be the direction that we want to go in.

47
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,880
 Or, for another example,

48
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,230
 if our earlier need-finding exercises revealed

49
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:10,730
 a significant number of exercisers carry weights or other things in their hands,

50
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,945
 then gestural interfaces start to look a lot less promising.

51
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:17,390
 Now, as video technology has gotten more and more ubiquitous,

52
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,095
 storyboards have also taken on a different form in a lot of prototypes that I have seen.

53
00:02:21,095 --> 00:02:25,160
 There's been an emergence of what is called video prototyping, which is basically,

54
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,280
 doing a video mockup of what someone would actually look like

55
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,430
 interacting with a certain interface to show to people so that they can see,

56
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,020
 whether or not, that would actually be something that

57
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,970
 would help them in their everyday life.

58
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,645
 So, storyboards taken into an extreme,

59
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:37,645
 could actually be a video mockup of what it would be like to use the finished product.
