00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,900
 In this lesson we've covered several different ways of developing design

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,290
 alternatives.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,750
 Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,870
 So, let's start rap the lesson up by exploring this with an exercise.

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,830
 Here are the methods that we've covered and

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,250
 here are some other potential advantages.

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,379
 For each row,

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,960
 mark which of the different methods possesses that advantage.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,500
 Note that these might be somewhat relative,

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:21,500
 so your answer might differ from ours and that's perfectly fine.
