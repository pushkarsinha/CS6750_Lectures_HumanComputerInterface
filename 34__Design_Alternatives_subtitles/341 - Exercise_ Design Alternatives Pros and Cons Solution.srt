1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,800
 So personally here's my answer.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,920
 For me scenarios are really the only ones that include the entire

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,550
 task context.

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,390
 You can make the case that personas and

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,160
 timelines do as well, but I tend to think that these are a little bit too

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,440
 separated from the task to really include the context.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,330
 Personas and user profiles, on the other hand, do include the users context.

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,350
 They include plenty of information about who the user is,

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,930
 why they're doing this task, and what their motivations are.

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,810
 You could make the argument as well,

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,885
 that scenarios and timelines include the user's context.

12
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:33,515
 Because the way we describe them, they're instances

13
00:00:33,515 --> 00:00:37,505
 of the personas being stretched out over a scenario or over time.

14
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:41,685
 User profile probably do the cleanest job of delineating the target audience.

15
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:44,425
 With our personas we have kind of a fuzzy idea of who are different

16
00:00:44,425 --> 00:00:45,290
 users are.

17
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,890
 But our user profiles really formally articulate the space of your users in

18
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,160
 which we're interested.

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,620
 As far as general workflows that's what user modeling is really good at.

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,750
 It really outlines the phases or

21
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,080
 steps or operators that users use in a general sense.

22
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,000
 You could say the same thing about timelines to a certain extent although

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,740
 timelines are more focused on what the user is thinking and feeling and

24
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,760
 less on their actual workflow with regard to the task.

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,030
 As far as capturing activity over time, scenarios, timelines, and

26
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,250
 user modeling all have an element of time in what they analyze.

27
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,220
 And possibly one of the bigger benefits of using scenarios

28
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,180
 is they allow us to capture potential edge cases more easily.

29
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,620
 Timelines, user models, user profiles and personas are all about

30
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,190
 the general user or the general routine interaction with the task.

31
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,970
 But scenarios let us pose interesting and novel situations so

32
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,570
 that we can kind of mentally simulate how our different design alternatives

33
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,060
 will work with that scenario.

34
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,580
 For example, we wouldn't say that a fire engine going by Morgan,

35
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,860
 which is listening to an audiobook, is a routine thing, so

36
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,050
 it probably wouldn't come up in our timeline or in our user modeling.

37
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,050
 But we can develop a scenario that explores how is she going to deal with

38
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,540
 that particular event.

39
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,490
 And while it might seem a little silly to focus so

40
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,410
 much on edge cases, as we do more and more design,

41
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,590
 we start to discover that there are a lot of edge cases.

42
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,070
 They're all different.

43
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,110
 But a lot of our time is spent dealing with those unique circumstances that

44
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,110
 fall pretty far outside the routine interaction with the program.
