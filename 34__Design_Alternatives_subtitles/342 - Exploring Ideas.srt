1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,950
 So let's apply these techniques to some of the ideas that I came up with

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,310
 earlier.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,930
 The first thing I might do is go ahead and

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,260
 rule out any of the ideas that are just technologically unfeasible.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,070
 Coming up with those wasn't a waste of time because they're part of a nice

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,720
 broad free flow brainstorming process.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,410
 But skin based interfaces and

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,370
 augmented reality, probably are not on the table for the immediate future.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,710
 I might also rule out the options that are unfeasible for

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,430
 some more practical reasons.

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,250
 We might a small team of developers, for example.

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,330
 So, a dedicated wearable device isn't really our expertise.

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,500
 Now the one I might do next is create some timelines, covering a sequence of

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,090
 events in exercising to use to explore these alternatives further.

15
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,101
 I might notice that the users I observed and talked with,

16
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:45,245
 valued efficiency in getting started.

17
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:49,084
 They don't want to have to walk through a complex set up process every time they

18
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:50,081
 start to exercise.

19
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:53,839
 I might also use my user persona's to explore the cognitive load of the users

20
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:56,160
 in these different alternatives.

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,760
 They have a lot going on, between monitoring their exercise progress,

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,160
 observing their environment, and listening to the book.

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,530
 So, I'm going to want to keep cognitive load very low.

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,780
 Now granted, we always want to keep cognitive load pretty low, but

25
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,790
 in this case, the competing tasks are significant enough,

26
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,490
 that I want to sacrifice features for

27
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,230
 simplicity, if it keeps that cognitive load pretty manageable.

28
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,170
 Now based on these timelines and these personas, I would probably

29
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,710
 end up here with three design alternatives that I want to explore.

30
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,880
 One is a traditional touch interface, a smartphone app.

31
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,575
 Then unfortunately it means the user is going to have to pull out their phone

32
00:01:28,575 --> 00:01:30,415
 whenever they want to take a note.

33
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:33,355
 But if I can design it well enough that might not be an issue.

34
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:36,335
 I also know that approach gets me a lot of flexibility so

35
00:01:36,335 --> 00:01:38,775
 it's good to at least explore it.

36
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:41,727
 A second approach is gestural interfaces.

37
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:45,215
 I know that people aren't usually holding their device while exercising.

38
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:47,817
 So it would be great if they had someway of interacting without pulling

39
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,082
 out their phone.

40
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:50,465
 Gestures might let us do that.

41
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:53,837
 Now in our gesture recognition is in its infancy, but

42
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:56,047
 we might be able delivered smart watched technology or

43
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:59,897
 something like a Fitbit to support interaction via gestures.

44
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:03,717
 A third approach is a voice interface, I know people generally aren't

45
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:07,390
 communicating verbally while exercising, so why not a voice interface?

46
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,860
 That can even double as the note taking interface.

47
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,750
 So now that I have three design alternatives that I'm

48
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,750
 interested in exploring, I would move on to the prototyping stage which is

49
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:16,750
 building some version of these that I can test with real users.
