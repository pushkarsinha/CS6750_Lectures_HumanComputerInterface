00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,085
 When you first start brainstorming,

2
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,590
 your goal is to generate a lot of ideas.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,060
 These ideas can be very short,

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,845
 very high level, and very general.

5
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:10,680
 Your goal is just to generate an expanse of them.

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,809
 They don't even have to be ideas for interfaces,

7
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,865
 just any idea for solving the problem.

8
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:19,305
 If you look online, you'll find lots of great guides to how to brainstorm ideas.

9
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:22,980
 One of the most interesting takeaways is that research generally indicates it's

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,030
 better to start with individual brainstorming. That's not intuitive though.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,324
 We often hold meetings for brainstorming,

12
00:00:29,324 --> 00:00:31,455
 but it should start out individually.

13
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:33,540
 That's because brainstorming is most effective

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,530
 when it initially generates a lot of ideas.

15
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,385
 But groups tend to coalesce around ideas pretty early.

16
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:40,290
 So, start out individually.

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,440
 Generate a lot of ideas.

18
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,154
 Each idea needs only be a few words or a sentence.

19
00:00:45,154 --> 00:00:48,320
 Don't worry right now if they're good or bad. Write down everything.

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,270
 Think about how you design with different types of

21
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,135
 interactions like gestures and voice and touch.

22
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:56,149
 Think about how you design for different interfaces like smartwatches,

23
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:58,115
 or tablets, or augmented reality.

24
00:00:58,115 --> 00:01:00,440
 Think about how you designed for different audiences,

25
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,725
 novices, and experts or kids and adults.

26
00:01:02,725 --> 00:01:06,715
 Get silly with it. Some of the best ideas start as silly ideas.

27
00:01:06,715 --> 00:01:09,095
 How would you design this for your dog or for your cat?

28
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:13,115
 How would you design this for someone with three arms or three legs? Go nuts.

29
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,905
 Your goal is to generate a lot of ideas.

30
00:01:15,905 --> 00:01:17,870
 These are going to get loaded into your mind,

31
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,815
 and they'll crop up in interesting ways throughout the rest of the design process.

32
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,395
 That's why it's important to generate a lot of ideas.

33
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:24,395
 You never know when they'll come up.
