1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,800
 The biggest mistake that a designer can make is jumping straight to designing

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,610
 an interface without understanding the users or understanding the task.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,190
 The second biggest mistake though is settling on a single design idea or

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,230
 a single genre of design ideas too early.

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,510
 This can take on multiple forms.

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,560
 One form is staying too allegiant to existing designs or products.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,670
 Take the thermostat, for example, again.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,090
 If you settled on tweaking the existing design of a thermostat

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,690
 you would never invent the Nest.

10
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,370
 So if you're working on improving an existing interface,

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,020
 try to actually distance yourself from the existing solutions,

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,860
 at least initially during the brainstorming session.

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,130
 But this is also a problem if you're designing interfaces for

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,040
 new tasks as well.

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,600
 Imagine for instance, that while you were observing people exercising, you

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,090
 started sketching interface ideas like how to make the buttons big enough or

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,420
 what buttons need to be featured prominently.

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,150
 In doing so, you're getting tunnel vision and missing out on any design

19
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,710
 alternatives that might involve voice or gesture control.

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,500
 So the second biggest mistake you can make is focusing

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,739
 too strongly on one alternative from the very beginning,

22
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,100
 instead of exploring the entire range of possible design alternatives.

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,840
 The reason why this is such a common mistake,

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,040
 is that there's this natural tendency to think of it as a waste of

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,750
 time to develop interfaces you're not going to end up using.

26
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,220
 You think you can get it done faster just by picking one early on and

27
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,480
 sticking to it.

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,820
 But flushing out ideas for interfaces you don't end up using isn't a waste of

29
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,810
 time, because by doing so you continue to learn more about the problem.

30
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,760
 The experience of exploring those ideas that you leave behind will make you

31
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,910
 a better designer for the ideas that you do choose to pursue.

32
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,950
 In all likelihood your ultimate design will be some combination of

33
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,510
 the design alternatives that you explored earlier.

34
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,730
 So, take my security system for an example.

35
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,950
 There are two ways of interacting with it, the key pad and the key chain.

36
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,370
 Two different designs that, in this particular instance,

37
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,150
 integrated just fine.

38
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,760
 Different alternatives won't always integrate side by side this easily,

39
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,910
 but the design process as a whole is an iterative process of brainstorming,

40
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,540
 combining, abandoning, revising and improving your ideas, and

41
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:01,540
 that requires you start with several ideas in the first place.
