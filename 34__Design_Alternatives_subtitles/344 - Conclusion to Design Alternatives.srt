00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:08,100
 The goal of the design alternative stage of the design life cycle is to generate

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,600
 lots of ideas and then synthesize those ideas into a handful worth exploring further.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,180
 So, we started with some heuristics for generating lots and lots of

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,540
 ideas through both individual and group brainstorming.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,640
 Then, we proposed some methods for exploring

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,965
 those ideas and deciding which ones to pursue.

7
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:24,980
 Now, these were all thought experiments.

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,005
 We haven't actually gotten to the point of designing any of these interfaces yet.

9
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:29,670
 That'll be the next stage.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,750
 At the end of the design alternative stage,

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,770
 we want to select a handful of designs that are worth carrying forward

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:34,770
 and prototyping to then give to users for actual feedback.
