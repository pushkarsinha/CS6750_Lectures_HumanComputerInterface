 The rules given by Osborn, Oxley,

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,070
 Dzindolet and Paulus are about helping

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,475
 individuals understand how they should act in group brainstorming.

4
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:14,100
 Here are a few additional tips though that apply less to

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,765
 the individual participants and more to the design of the activity as a whole.

6
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:22,515
 Number one, go through every individual idea.

7
00:00:22,515 --> 00:00:25,110
 Have participants perform individual brainstorming ahead of

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,260
 time and bring ideas to the group brainstorming session,

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,780
 and explicitly make sure to go through each one.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,565
 That will help avoid converging around an idea too early and make sure everyone is heard.

11
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:38,945
 Number two, find the optimal size.

12
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:42,620
 Social loafing occurs when there's a lack of individual responsibility.

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,679
 When you have so many people that not everyone will get to talk anyway,

14
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,945
 it's easy for disengagement to occur.

15
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:50,090
 I would say group brainstorming session should generally

16
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,120
 not involve more than five people.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,800
 If more people need to give perspectives than that,

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,715
 then you can have intermediate groups that then send ideas along to a later group.

19
00:00:58,715 --> 00:01:02,435
 Number three, set clear rules for communication.

20
00:01:02,435 --> 00:01:05,905
 Get a 20-second timer and when someone starts talking, start it.

21
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:07,320
 Once the timer is up,

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,925
 someone else gets to speak.

23
00:01:08,925 --> 00:01:12,080
 The goal is to ensure that no one can block others ideas

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,605
 by talking too much whether intentionally or accidentally.

25
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:19,250
 Number four, set clear expectations.

26
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,635
 Enthusiasm starts to wane when people are

27
00:01:21,635 --> 00:01:24,755
 unsure how long a session will go or what will mark its end.

28
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:27,350
 You might set the session to go a certain amount of time or

29
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,095
 dictate that a certain number of ideas must get generated.

30
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:31,790
 No matter how you do it,

31
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,230
 make sure that people participating can

32
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,065
 assess where in the brainstorming session they are.

33
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:40,369
 Number five, end with ideas, not decisions.

34
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:43,010
 It's tempting to want to leave a brainstorming session with

35
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,400
 a single idea on which to move forward, but that's not the goal.

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,975
 Your brainstorming session should end with several ideas,

37
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:52,400
 then let them percolate in everyone's mind

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,400
 before coming back and choosing the ideas to pursue later.
