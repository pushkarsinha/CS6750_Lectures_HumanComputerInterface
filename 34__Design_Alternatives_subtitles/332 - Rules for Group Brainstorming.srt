1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,717
 To have an effective group brainstorming session, we need to have some rules to

2
00:00:03,717 --> 00:00:07,058
 govern the individual's behavior to address those common challenges.

3
00:00:07,058 --> 00:00:10,628
 In 1957, Osbourne outline four such rules.

4
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:13,930
 Number one, Expressiveness.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,028
 Any idea that comes to mind, share it out loud, no matter how strange.

6
00:00:17,028 --> 00:00:20,660
 Number two, nonevaluation.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,326
 No criticizing ideas, no evaluating the ideas themselves yet.

8
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:26,811
 Number three, quantity.

9
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:29,210
 Brainstorming as many as possible.

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,046
 The more you have, the greater your idea of finding a novel idea.

11
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:35,540
 Number four, building.

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,790
 While you shouldn't criticize other's ideas,

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,778
 you should absolutely try to build on them.

14
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:45,333
 Then, in 1996, Oxley, Dzindolet and Paulus presented four additional rules.

15
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,860
 Number one, stay focused.

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,470
 Keep the goal in mind at all times.

17
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,450
 Number two, no explaining ideas.

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,340
 Say the idea and move on.

19
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,420
 No justifying ideas.

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,310
 Number three, when you hit a roadblock, revisit the problem.

21
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,760
 Say it again out loud.

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,520
 Number four, encourage others.

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,240
 If someone isn't speaking up, encourage them to do so.

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,260
 Note that all eight of these rules prescribe what individuals should do,

25
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,520
 but they're only effective if every individual does them.

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,440
 So it's good to cover these rules, post them publicly, and

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:20,440
 call one another on breaking from them.
