1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,820
 The first common method we can use to flush out design alternatives is called

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,920
 personas.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,220
 With personas we create actual characters to represent our users.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,200
 So let's create a persona for

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,340
 the problem of helping exercisers take notes while reading books.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,640
 We'll start by giving her a name and a face,

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,440
 and then we'll fill out some details.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,550
 We want to understand who this persona is.

9
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,690
 We want to be able to mentally simulate her.

10
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,700
 We want to be able to say, what would Anika do in this situation?

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,200
 What is she thinking when she's about to go exercise?

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,667
 What kind of things might interrupt her?

13
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:32,100
 We might want to put in some more domain specific information as well.

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,130
 Like, why does this person exercise?

15
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,420
 When do they exercise?

16
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,990
 What kind of books do they like?

17
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,760
 How are they feeling when they're exercising?

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,872
 Where do they usually exercise?

19
00:00:40,872 --> 00:00:43,830
 We want to create at least three or four of these different personas, and perhaps

20
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,390
 more depending on how many different stakeholders we have for our problem.

21
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,310
 The important thing is that these should be pretty different people,

22
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,370
 representing different elements of our designs,

23
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,350
 different elements of our task, so we can explore its entire range.

24
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,640
 We don't want to design just for Anika, but we do want to design for

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,650
 real people.

26
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,580
 And so we should define personas that represent the range of real people that

27
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,870
 we care about.

28
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,740
 That way we can ask our questions like,

29
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,680
 how would Janet feel about this design alternative?

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,080
 Using this, we can start to extort the space and

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,080
 find the options that has the most appeal.
