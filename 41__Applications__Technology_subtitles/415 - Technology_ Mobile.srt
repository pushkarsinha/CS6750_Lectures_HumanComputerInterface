00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
 One of the biggest changes to computing over the past several years

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,555
 has been the incredible growth of mobile as a computing platform.

3
00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:08,580
 We really live in a mobile first world,

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,325
 and that introduces some significant design challenges.

5
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:13,440
 Screen real estate is now far more limited.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,940
 The input methods are less precise,

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,620
 and the user is distracted.

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,699
 The mobile computing also presents some really big opportunities for HCI.

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,080
 Thanks in large part to mobile,

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,215
 we're no longer interested just in a person sitting in front of a computer.

11
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:29,025
 With mobile phones, most people have a computer with them at all times anyway.

12
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:33,220
 We can use that to support experiences from navigation to stargazing.

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,085
 Mobile computing is deeply related to fields like context-aware computing,

14
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:39,560
 ubiquitous computing, and augmented reality as it

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,530
 possesses the hardware necessary to complement those efforts.

16
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,780
 But even on its own, mobile computing presents some fascinating challenges to address.

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,670
 For me, the big one is that we haven't yet reached a point where we can

18
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,535
 use mobile phones for all the tasks we do on computers.

19
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,590
 Smart phones are great for social networking,

20
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,080
 personal organization, games, and lots of other things.

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,690
 But we haven't yet reached a point where the majority of people would

22
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,750
 sit down to write an essay or do some programming on smartphones.

23
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,840
 Why haven't we? What do we need to do to make smart phones into

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:05,840
 true replacements for traditional desktop and laptop computers?
