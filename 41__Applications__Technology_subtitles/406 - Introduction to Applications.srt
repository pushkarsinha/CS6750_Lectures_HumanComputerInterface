00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,180
 If you're watching this course in the order it was originally produced,

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,160
 you've now learned the foundational principles of

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,805
 HCI and the research methods behind developing interfaces.

4
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:16,395
 Now at the beginning of the course,

5
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:20,940
 we also previewed some of the open areas of HCI development and research.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,370
 Now, what we'd like to do is give you a jump-start in

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,100
 looking into what areas are most interesting to you.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,615
 In the lessons that follow,

9
00:00:27,615 --> 00:00:31,280
 we'll replay the preview videos for each topic from the beginning of the course,

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,985
 and then provide a small library of information on each topic.

11
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:38,975
 We certainly don't expect you to go through every portion of all these lessons.

12
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:38,975
 Find what's interesting to you and use these materials as your jumping off point.
