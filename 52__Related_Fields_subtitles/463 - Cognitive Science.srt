1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,965
 When we described mental models,

2
00:00:01,965 --> 00:00:03,780
 we were actually briefly touching on

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,155
 a deep body of literature from the cognitive science field.

4
00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:10,395
 Cognitive science is the general study of human thought,

5
00:00:10,395 --> 00:00:12,615
 mental organization, and memory.

6
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:15,735
 Now, cognitive science isn't a subfield of HCI,

7
00:00:15,735 --> 00:00:19,875
 but HCI informs a good portion of cognitive science research.

8
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:24,220
 That's because HCI gives us a way to explore aspects of human cognition.

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,760
 We can design interfaces that assume humans think or process in a certain way,

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,705
 and we can use the results of those interfaces to further develop our theories.

11
00:00:32,705 --> 00:00:35,810
 In this way, HCI is a probe into

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,990
 human thought that informs the development of cognitive science,

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,465
 and cognitive science, in turn,

14
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:45,505
 gives us theories on human abilities that inform the interfaces that we design.

15
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:50,660
 So, if you're interested in studying people more closely using HCI as a probe or a tool,

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:50,660
 we'll give you some more resources to explore.
