00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,530
 For a lot of people,

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,880
 HCI and user experience design are essentially the same thing.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,670
 For me though, UX design is a little bit more

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,495
 prescriptive while HCI is a little bit more descriptive.

5
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:16,424
 HCI describes how people learn and interpret interfaces

6
00:00:16,424 --> 00:00:20,805
 while UX design prescribes what you should do with that information.

7
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:23,535
 But in many ways, let's just apply the HCI.

8
00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:24,720
 The content is the same.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,830
 The question is how you use it.

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,050
 If you choose to continue your studies in UX design though,

11
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,135
 there are a few new things you'll encounter.

12
00:00:32,135 --> 00:00:35,490
 You'll see an increased focus on the mood and the joy of the user.

13
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,025
 We want them to have a great experience not just accomplish a task.

14
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:40,580
 You'll see more attention paid to

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,700
 the user's motivations behind engaging with the interface.

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,210
 You also see a greater emphasis on the interaction between the user,

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,940
 the interface, and the contexts all around them,

18
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,705
 as these are all parts of the user experience.

19
00:00:52,705 --> 00:00:55,010
 These are all things we've talked about but

20
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,130
 user experience gets into prescribing these with more specificity.

21
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,660
 So, if you want some more information on user experience design,

22
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:01,660
 we'll put some resources in the notes below.
