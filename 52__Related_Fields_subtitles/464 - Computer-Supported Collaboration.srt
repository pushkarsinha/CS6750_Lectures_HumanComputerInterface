00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,815
 When we discussed feedback cycles,

2
00:00:01,815 --> 00:00:04,290
 we mentioned that the user experience applies not only

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,380
 at the individual level but also at the group level.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,900
 Distributed cognition too was interested in

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,930
 how interactions between people can be mediated by

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,750
 interfaces and how the output and knowledge of

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,190
 those interactions can't be attributed narrowly to one particular part of the system,

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,215
 but rather to the system as a whole.

9
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:24,510
 The ubiquity of human interaction and

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,120
 the potential of computers to mediate interactions between

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,860
 people gives rise to field that investigate collaboration across interfaces.

12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,160
 These fields ask questions like: how can computers be

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,415
 used to allow people to collaborate across distance and across time,

14
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:41,720
 and how can computers be used to enhance the collaboration

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,415
 of people working together at the same place at the same time?

16
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:48,050
 These fields look at how computers can support things

17
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,765
 like cooperative work in collaborative learning.

18
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:53,960
 For example, how does Wikipedia enable people across

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,260
 enormous variations in location and time to work together to capture knowledge?

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,890
 Or how do online courses allow teachers and

21
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,865
 students to interact and learn asynchronously across distances?

22
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:08,480
 Or how can computers be used to facilitate conversations between people

23
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,310
 with different backgrounds and expertises and even languages?

24
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,450
 These are pretty well-developed fields.

25
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,650
 So, if you'd like to learn more,

26
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:15,650
 we'll put some more information in the notes below.
