00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,145
 Human-computer interaction is a massive field with lots of subdomains.

2
00:00:08,145 --> 00:00:12,255
 This course has been a combination of the fundamental methods and principles of HCI,

3
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:14,875
 but there are lots of directions you could go from here.

4
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:19,355
 In this lesson, I've attempted to give you some ideas of where you might look next.

5
00:00:19,355 --> 00:00:22,100
 You might be interested in the research side of HCI and

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,230
 exploring more about how technology influences the way people think and act.

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,670
 You might be interested in the design side and

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,835
 creating excellent user interfaces and experiences.

9
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:34,220
 You might be interested in collaboration and helping

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,650
 people interact across technology or you

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,690
 might be interested in artificial intelligence and

12
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,705
 designing interfaces that adapt to the user's needs.

13
00:00:41,705 --> 00:00:45,810
 Whatever your interest, there's a rich amount of content in HCI in front of you.

14
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,870
 Now, the last thing we need to think about is,

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:47,870
 how do you best get that content?
