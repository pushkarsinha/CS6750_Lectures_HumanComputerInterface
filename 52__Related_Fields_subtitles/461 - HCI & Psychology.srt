00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,710
 Early in our conversations,

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:06,735
 we described how HCI is generally about an interaction between design and research.

3
00:00:06,735 --> 00:00:09,780
 We use research findings to inform our designs,

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,635
 and we use the success of our designs to create new research findings.

5
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:15,690
 As you explore more HCI though,

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,780
 you'll find that there's plenty of room to specialize in one side of the other.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,920
 Professional designers focus almost exclusively on the creation side,

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,000
 but there are lots of people who focus exclusively on the research side of HCI.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,800
 Many universities like Georgia Tech and

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,560
 Carnegie Mellon have research faculty dedicated to

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,929
 understanding the way people interact with technology

12
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:36,690
 at individual group and societal levels.

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,090
 So, if you're more interested in understanding how

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,970
 people interact with interfaces than in designing new ones,

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,860
 you might be interested in taking more of a research bent on HCI.

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,630
 This class is actually built from

17
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,180
 the research perspective more than the designer perspective,

18
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,010
 so you've already got a great foundation.

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,010
 We'll add some links below if you want to explore some more.
