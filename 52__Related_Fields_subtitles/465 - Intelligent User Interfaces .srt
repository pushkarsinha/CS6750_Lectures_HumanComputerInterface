00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,110
 To close out, my work is at the intersection of artificial intelligence,

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,765
 human-computer interaction, and education.

3
00:00:06,765 --> 00:00:11,875
 My research is largely on how to use AI to create valuable learning experiences.

4
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:14,750
 Setting aside the education part for a second, though,

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,720
 there's a rich interaction between artificial intelligence and

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,640
 human-computer interaction in the form of what we call intelligent user interfaces.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,250
 This field looks at how we can apply AI techniques to

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,300
 adapting user interfaces to their users.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,280
 Now, an infamous example of this is Clippy,

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,945
 the Microsoft Office assistant.

11
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:37,355
 He tried to infer what you're working on and give you in-context feedback on it.

12
00:00:37,355 --> 00:00:41,020
 Intelligent user interfaces have come a long way since then, though.

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,440
 Google Now, for example,

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,210
 is consistently trying to learn from your

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,225
 routine and give you information when you need it.

16
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:49,010
 One of my favorite experiences with

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,610
 intelligent user interfaces came from the interaction between Google Maps,

18
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,545
 Gmail, and Google Calendar.

19
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:56,990
 Google Calendar had automatically imported

20
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,195
 a restaurant reservation I had made from Gmail along with the location of the restaurant.

21
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:04,010
 Then, Google Maps, knowing where I was,

22
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,295
 detected that there was unusual traffic between me and the reservation,

23
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:10,265
 and it buzz me to let me know when to leave to arrive on time.

24
00:01:10,265 --> 00:01:12,680
 I hadn't checked traffic, but I was on time for

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,520
 my reservation because of the intelligence of that user interface.

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,245
 It knew what I needed to know and when I needed to know it.

27
00:01:20,245 --> 00:01:24,185
 So, if you'd like to hear more about the overlap between artificial intelligence,

28
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:27,065
 human-computer interaction, and intelligent user interfaces,

29
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:27,065
 we'll put some information in the notes below.
