00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,365
 HCI research broadens to a field called human-centered computing.

2
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:06,450
 While much of HCI research is concerned with

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,510
 the immediate interactions between people and computers,

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,270
 human-centered computing is interested more generally in

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,350
 how computers and humans affect each other at the societal level.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,440
 There's a lot of really fascinating research going on in this area.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,870
 Some of the questions people are addressing are,

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,950
 how did participants in

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,820
 the Arab Spring use tools like Facebook and Twitter to coordinate?

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,760
 How can information visualizations be employed to help

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,200
 people better understand their diet and their energy usage?

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,685
 How does access to computing resources influence early childhood education?

13
00:00:37,685 --> 00:00:40,070
 Now, notice that these issues don't necessarily

14
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,950
 involve designing new interfaces or creating new tools.

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,865
 They involve looking at the way people interact with computers more generally,

16
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:48,815
 and not just specific tools,

17
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,175
 but the ubiquity of technology as a whole.

18
00:00:51,175 --> 00:00:52,810
 So, if you find this interesting,

19
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:52,810
 we'll put some more materials in the notes below.
