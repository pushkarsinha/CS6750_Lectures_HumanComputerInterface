00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,009
 To talk about cognitive load, let's think for

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,470
 a moment of the brain like it's a computer.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,460
 The community is actually divided on whether or

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,800
 not the brain actually operates this way, but for

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,570
 the purposes of this explanation, it's a useful metaphor.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,505
 So your brain has a certain number of resources available to it, the same way

7
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:17,795
 your computer has a certain number of processor resources available to it.

8
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:21,455
 Each thing that the brain is working on takes up some of those resources.

9
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:24,649
 Let's say your at home in a quiet area, working on a calculus problem that

10
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,432
 requires 60% of your cognitive resources.

11
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:31,032
 In that setting, you have plenty of resources to solve that problem.

12
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:33,672
 However, then you go to take a calculus test.

13
00:00:33,672 --> 00:00:35,282
 Now you have some stress in there.

14
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:36,872
 Now you're stressing about the impact this

15
00:00:36,872 --> 00:00:38,252
 test is going to have on your grade.

16
00:00:38,252 --> 00:00:40,860
 You're stressing about how well other people seem to think they

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,520
 are doing on it.

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,240
 Whether or not other people seem to be struggling while you struggle.

19
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,730
 This is taking up a lot of your cognitive resources.

20
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,940
 Here we see the stress taking up 50% of the cognitive resources you have.

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,670
 Now you don't have sufficient resources to complete the problem successfully.

22
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,630
 I hypothesize that's why test taking anxiety can have such a negative effect.

23
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,020
 It takes resources away from actually working on the test.

24
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,099
 You can apply these same principles to the presence of distractions,

25
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,504
 anxiety disorders and more.

26
00:01:06,504 --> 00:01:09,710
 Cognitive load has two major applications to our working design

27
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,950
 interfaces.

28
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,610
 One, we want to reduce the cognitive load posed by the interface, so

29
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,120
 that the user can focus on the task.

30
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,720
 Second, we want to understand the context of what else is going on while

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,378
 users are using our interface.

32
00:01:22,378 --> 00:01:24,569
 We need to understand what else is competing for

33
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:27,920
 the cognitive resources users need to use our interface.

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,440
 If we're designing a GPS or navigation system for

35
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,390
 example, we want to be aware that the user will have relatively

36
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:33,390
 few cognitive resources because they're focusing on so many things at once.
