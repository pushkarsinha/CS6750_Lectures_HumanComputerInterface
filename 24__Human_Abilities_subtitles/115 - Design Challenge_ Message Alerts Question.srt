00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,460
 Let's design something for Morgan real quick.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,080
 Let's tackle the common problem of being alerted when you've received

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,530
 a text message.

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,990
 Here are the constraints on our design for Morgan.

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,350
 It must alert her whether the phone is in her pocket or on the table.

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,845
 It cannot disturb the people around her.

7
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:17,893
 [SOUND] And yes, vibrating loudly against the table counts as disturbing

8
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,231
 the people around her.

9
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:21,738
 You're not restricted to just one modality, though, but

10
00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:21,738
 you are restricted to the sensors that the phone has available.
