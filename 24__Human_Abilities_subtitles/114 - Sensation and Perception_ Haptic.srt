1
00:00:00,445 --> 00:00:02,540
 Morgan's skin can feel things.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,860
 It can't feel at a distance but

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,480
 it can feel when things are touching right up against it.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,960
 It can feel a variety of different types of input, like pressure,

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,320
 vibration and temperature.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,790
 Like listening, Morgan can't easily filter out touch feedback.

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,590
 But unlike listening, touch feedback is generally only available to the person

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,240
 it's touching, so it can be used to create more personal feedback.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,670
 Traditionally, touch feedback, or haptic feedback, has been very natural.

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,988
 Morgan feels the keys go down as she presses them on keyboard.

11
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:32,439
 But with touchscreens, motion controls and virtual reality, touch needs to

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:32,439
 be more and more designed explicitly into the system if we're to use it.
