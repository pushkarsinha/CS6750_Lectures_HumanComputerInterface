1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,430
 Let's start by talking a bit about what the average person can sense and

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,330
 perceive.

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,100
 So, here we have Morgan again.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,710
 Morgan has eyes.

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,080
 Morgan's eyes are useful for a lot of things.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,790
 The center of Morgan's eye is most useful for focusing closely on color or

7
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,490
 tracking movement.

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,020
 So, we can assume that the most important details should be placed in

9
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,650
 the center of her view.

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,790
 Morgan's peripheral vision is good for detecting motion, but

11
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,183
 it isn't as good for detecting color or detail.

12
00:00:25,183 --> 00:00:27,477
 So while we might use her periphery for some alerts,

13
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:30,920
 we shouldn't require her to focus closely on anything out there.

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,240
 As a woman, Morgan is unlikely to be colorblind,

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,770
 she has about a 1 in 200 chance.

16
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,800
 Men have a much greater prevalence of color blindness at about 1 in 12.

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,130
 Either way, that's a significant body of people.

18
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,117
 So we want to avoid relying on color to understand the interface.

19
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:48,847
 We can use it to emphasize knowledge that it's already present in the system,

20
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:52,290
 but using the system shouldn't rely on perceiving color.

21
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,992
 Sight is directional.

22
00:00:53,992 --> 00:00:56,180
 If Morgan's looking the wrong way or has her eyes closed,

23
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,530
 she'll miss visual feedback.

24
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,120
 As Morgan gets older, her visual acuity will decrease.

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,569
 So if we're designing something with older audiences in mind,

26
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,130
 we want to be careful of things like font size.

27
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,980
 Ideally, these would be adjustable to meet the needs of multiple audiences.

28
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,220
 All together though,

29
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,620
 Morgan's visual system is hugely important to her cognition.

30
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,306
 The majority of concepts we cover in HCI are likely connected to visual

31
00:01:19,306 --> 00:01:20,063
 perception.

32
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:20,063
