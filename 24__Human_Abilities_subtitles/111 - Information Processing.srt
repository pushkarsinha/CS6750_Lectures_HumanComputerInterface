00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,830
 In discussing human abilities,

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,960
 we're going to adopt something similar to the processor view of the human.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,010
 For now we're interested in what they can do,

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,010
 physically, cognitively, and so on.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,330
 So we're going to focus exclusively on what's going on over here.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,570
 We're going to look at how the person makes sense of input, and

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,310
 how they then act in the world.

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,890
 And right now, we're not going to worry too much about where that input came

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,950
 from, or what their actions in the world actually do.

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,860
 Notice that in this lesson we're discussing the human, almost the same

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,530
 way we discuss the computer, or the interface, in most lessons.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,280
 The human is something that produces output and

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,690
 consumes input, just like a computer might be otherwise.

14
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:35,690
 But for now, we're only interested in how the human does this.
