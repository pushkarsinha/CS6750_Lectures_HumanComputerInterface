1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,010
 So what are the implications of short term memory for HCI?

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,570
 We don't want to ask the user to hold too much in memory at a time,

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,540
 four to five chunks is all.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,250
 Asking the user to hold ten numbers in short term memory, for example,

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,300
 would probably be too much.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,210
 But we can increase the user's effective short term memory capacity by helping

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,470
 them chunk things.

8
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,390
 For example, this is probably by far easier to remember,

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,180
 even though it's the same content.

10
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,610
 We've shrunk ten items into three.

11
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,910
 And we've used a format for

12
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,250
 phone numbers with which you're probably familiar if you're in the United States.

13
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,450
 If you're from outside the U.S.,

14
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,220
 you might be familiar with a different grouping.

15
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,470
 But the same principle applies.

16
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,370
 And finally, when possible, we should leverage recognition over recall.

17
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,010
 For example, if I ask you to recite the number, maybe you could.

18
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,320
 In fact, go ahead.

19
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,362
 Try it.

20
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:47,002
 Whether or not you could do that, you almost certainly, though,

21
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:48,680
 can pick it from this list.

22
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,220
 This is one of the reasons why menu bars and tool strips are so

23
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,010
 ubiquitous in software design.

24
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,350
 The user doesn't have to remember the icon for a command or

25
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,267
 the name of an option.

26
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:56,267
 They just have to recognize it when they see it.
