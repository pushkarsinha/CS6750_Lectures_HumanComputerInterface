1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,540
 After the perception portion of this model comes the cognition portion,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,160
 starting with memory.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,490
 There are lots of different models of memory out there.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,510
 For our purposes we're going to talk about three different kinds of memory,

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,950
 the perceptual store or working memory, the short-term memory, and

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,340
 the long term memory.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,990
 Some scientists argue that there are other types of memory as well,

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,920
 like an intermediate sort of back of the mind memory.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,920
 But the greatest consensus is around the existence of at least these three kinds.

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,690
 So let's start with the first, the perceptual store or the working memory.

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,810
 The perceptual store is a very short term memory lasting less than a second.

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,940
 One of the most common models of working memory came from Baddeley and

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,800
 Hitch in 1974.

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,230
 They described it as having three parts.

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,750
 First, there's the visuospatial sketchpad which holds visual information

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,760
 for active manipulation.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,180
 So for example, picture a pencil.

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,940
 The visuospatial sketchpad is where you're currently seeing that pencil.

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,780
 A second part is the phonological loop.

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,760
 The phonological loop is similar, but for verbal or auditory information.

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,960
 It stores the sounds or speech you've heard recently,

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,280
 such as the sound of me talking to you right now.

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,590
 A third part is the episodic buffer.

24
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,550
 The episodic buffer takes care of integrating information from the other

25
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,780
 systems as well as chronological ordering to put things in place.

26
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,360
 Finally all three of these are coordinated by a central executive.

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,170
 So let's try an example of this.

28
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,810
 I'm going to very quickly show you a picture and ask you a question about it.

29
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:31,528
 Don't focus on any particular portion of the picture, try to view it as a whole.

30
00:01:31,528 --> 00:01:31,528
 What was the score on the scoreboard?
