00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,870
 We've talked a lot about different human abilities in this lesson.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,460
 Depending on the domain you chose,

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,475
 the human abilities in which you're interested may vary dramatically.

4
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:14,300
 If you're looking at gestural interfaces or wearable devices,

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,550
 then the limitations of the human motor system might be very important.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,280
 On the other hand, if you're interested in educational technology,

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,660
 you are likely more interested in some of

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,840
 the cognitive issues surrounding designing technology.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,765
 For virtual reality, your main concern would likely be perception.

10
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:29,835
 Although, there are interesting open questions about how we

11
00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:32,410
 physically interact with virtual reality as well.

12
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,310
 So, take a few moments and reflect on what the limitations of

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:35,310
 human ability are in the domain of HCI that you chose to explore.
