1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,710
 Morgan also has ears.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,620
 Morgan can discern noises based on both their pitch and their loudness.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,210
 Her ears are remarkably good at localizing sound as well.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,550
 In fact, she can tell the difference between a nearby quiet sound and

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,260
 a far away loud sound.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,640
 Even if their relative pitches and

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,290
 loudnesses are the same when they reach her ear.

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,020
 Unlike vision, hearing isn't directional.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,250
 Morgan can't close her ears or point her ears the wrong direction so

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,330
 she can't as easily filter out auditory information.

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,300
 That might be useful for designing alerts, but it's problematic for

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:31,300
 overwhelming her or sharing too much information with the people around her.
