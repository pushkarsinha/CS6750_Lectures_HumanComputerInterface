1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,475
 Now let's talk a little bit about cognition.

2
00:00:02,475 --> 00:00:06,240
 One of the most important cognitive processes to consider is learning.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,890
 When we design interfaces,

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,960
 we are in some ways hoping the user has to learn

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,945
 as little as possible to find the interface useful.

6
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:15,240
 However, our interfaces should also teach

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,910
 the user over time how to use them most efficiently.

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,745
 We can take PowerPoint as an example of this.

9
00:00:20,745 --> 00:00:22,890
 Let's pretend this is the first time I've ever used

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,200
 PowerPoint and I want to copy something.

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,080
 This application doesn't assume I know anything yet.

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,210
 If I poke around, I'll find the Copy button under

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,090
 the Edit menu which is off-screen above the slide.

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,510
 When I bring up that menu,

15
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,305
 it also shows the hotkey that will allow me to actually copy something.

16
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:40,850
 That's helping me learn to interact with the application

17
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,955
 more efficiently through hotkeys instead of through menus.

18
00:00:43,955 --> 00:00:46,430
 But yet it's also not assuming that I already knew

19
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,415
 that because I was still able to find this under that menu.

20
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:54,060
 There are two kinds of learning we're most interested in: procedural and declarative.

21
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,280
 Procedural is how to do something.

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,065
 That could be doing work on the computer,

23
00:00:58,065 --> 00:01:00,345
 playing sports, playing a musical instrument.

24
00:01:00,345 --> 00:01:03,725
 It's a task in which you're engaged or an activity you're performing.

25
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:05,480
 It's something that you do.

26
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,720
 Declarative learning is knowledge about something.

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,090
 It's what you know in your head.

28
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,050
 It's what you can answer when asked.

29
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,430
 So, if I asked you,

30
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,530
 what's the hotkey for paste?

31
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,720
 I'm asking for a declarative knowledge.

32
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,705
 If I asked you, paste your clipboard here,

33
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,865
 I'm asking for procedural knowledge.

34
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:24,710
 If you're an expert computer user,

35
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,260
 you'd probably find it easier to just actually paste

36
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,260
 your clipboard than to answer me when I say what's the hotkey for paste.

37
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,390
 In all likelihood, when I ask you what's the hotkey for paste,

38
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,220
 the way you remember it is you mentally simulate

39
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,900
 doing it and then you look at what you simulated yourself doing.

40
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,730
 What's interesting is that while a declarative knowledge is

41
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,070
 how we generally communicate with one another,

42
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,920
 procedural knowledge is generally what we do in HCI.

43
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,760
 When you have strong procedural knowledge,

44
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,440
 you may forget how you're doing what you're doing because it's so second nature.

45
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,590
 You're unconsciously competent with what you're doing.

46
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,650
 When you're in that state, it can be difficult to explain to someone who lacks

47
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,690
 that competence because you aren't sure what makes you so good at it.

48
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,910
 It's difficult to translate

49
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,480
 your subconscious procedural knowledge into explicit declarative knowledge.

50
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,570
 But declarative knowledge is how we communicate.

51
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,620
 That's how we communicate with novice users.

52
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,685
 This is important because as the designers of interfaces,

53
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:17,670
 we're the experts in our domains.

54
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,760
 That means we're prone to designing things that are easy for

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:19,760
 us to use but hard for anyone else.
