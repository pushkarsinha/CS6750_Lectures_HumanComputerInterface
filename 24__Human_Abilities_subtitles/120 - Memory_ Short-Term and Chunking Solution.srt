1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,340
 So what happened?

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,059
 Well, what likely happened is that you maybe had only a little

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,421
 bit of trouble remembering the two real words that were listed on the right.

4
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:10,456
 You might have had some more trouble remembering the two words that were

5
00:00:10,456 --> 00:00:12,429
 listed in the middle that were fake words, but

6
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,109
 did nonetheless look like real words.

7
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:16,847
 And you probably had a lot of trouble remembering the two series of letters

8
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:18,220
 over on the left.

9
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,650
 Why is all of that?

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,060
 Well, when it came to memorizing these two words,

11
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,420
 you were just calling up a chunk that you've already had.

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,720
 You didn't see these as arbitrary collections of letters,

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,580
 you just saw them as words.

14
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,400
 For the ones in the middle, you've never seen those combinations of letters

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,730
 before, but you could pronounce them as if they were words.

16
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,240
 So you likely saw them as fake words rather than just

17
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,910
 random collection of letters.

18
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,170
 For these over the left though, you had to memorize five individual characters.

19
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,171
 So that's means that while these four were able to jump in the words or

20
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,190
 pseudo words.

21
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,330
 These likely had to be remembered as five chunks each.

22
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:50,330
 That's makes this much more difficult to remember than these.
