1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,920
 As you can now see, the score was 0 to 0.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,756
 Now, as you tried to reason over that,

3
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:08,439
 what you probably did was picture the image in your mind.

4
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:11,575
 That was trying to reason over what was stored in the perceptual buffer, and

5
00:00:11,575 --> 00:00:12,668
 it decayed very quickly.

6
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:15,120
 However, if you're a fan of baseball,

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,550
 you probably had a better chance of getting that right.

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,653
 That's because you have some domain expertise.

9
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,902
 You're better able to process images about that domain more quickly.

10
00:00:22,902 --> 00:00:26,702
 You might, for example, have recognized that most of the innings weren't marked.

11
00:00:26,702 --> 00:00:30,260
 So that increases the odds that the score of the game was pretty low.

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,350
 This idea is actually the foundation of a fascinating study about chess experts

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,902
 versus novices and recognizing the configuration of chess boards.

14
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:41,102
 The study found that experts were far better than novices at remembering

15
00:00:41,102 --> 00:00:44,355
 realistic chess boards that were only flashed for a short period of time,

16
00:00:44,355 --> 00:00:46,330
 like the one on the left.

17
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,780
 But experts were no better than novices at remembering random chessboards.

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:50,780
 So expertise, or rehearsal, delays the decay of the perceptual buffer.
