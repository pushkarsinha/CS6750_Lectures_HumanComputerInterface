1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,430
 Even if you had trouble just naming these series of letters in the exercise

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,320
 previously.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,190
 You probably were much more successful at this exercise.

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,420
 Why is that?

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,920
 That's because it's far easier to recognize something you know than to

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,620
 recall it independently.

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,540
 And that's a useful take away for us as we design interfaces.

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,541
 We can minimize the memory load on the user by relying more on their ability to

9
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:20,541
 recognize things than to recall them
