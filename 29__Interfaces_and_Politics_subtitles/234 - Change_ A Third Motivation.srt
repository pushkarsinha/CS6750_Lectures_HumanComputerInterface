00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,950
 Most commonly in HCI, we're interesting in designing for usability.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,311
 We want to make tasks easier through technology.

3
00:00:06,311 --> 00:00:09,876
 So in a car, we might be interested in designing a GPS that can be used with

4
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:11,227
 the fewest number of taps.

5
00:00:11,227 --> 00:00:16,360
 Or a dashboard that surfaces the most important information at the right time.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,720
 Sometimes we're also interested in designing for research, though.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,680
 We might design a dashboard that includes some kind of visualization

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,620
 of the speed to see if that changes the way the person perceives how fast

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,970
 that they're going.

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,320
 But a third motivation is to somehow change the user's behavior.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,760
 Designing for change in response to some value that we have.

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,980
 Often times that may actually conflict with those other motivations.

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,530
 If we're trying to discourage an unhealthy habit,

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,720
 we might want to make the interface for that habit less usable.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,220
 Cars actually have a lot of interfaces created with that motivation in mind.

16
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,440
 If I started driving without a seatbelt on, my car will beep at me.

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,150
 Some cars will cap your speed at a certain number.

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,810
 Those interfaces serve no usability goals but

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,170
 rather they serve the goal of user safety.

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,083
 Now, that's a simplistic example, but

21
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,800
 it shows what I call the three goals of HCI.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,930
 Help a user do a task, understand how a user does a task, or change the way

23
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:06,930
 a user does a task due to some value that we hold, like safety or privacy.
