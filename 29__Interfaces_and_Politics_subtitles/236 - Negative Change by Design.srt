1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,260
 Let's start with the bad news.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,420
 The ability of interfaces to change behavior can be abused.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,290
 We're not just talking about places where people put explicit barriers

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,770
 up like blocking certain people from accessing their content.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,970
 There are instances where people create seemingly normal designs with

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,400
 underlying political motivations.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,800
 Winner describes one such instance in his essay Do Artifacts Have Politics?

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,290
 Robert Moses was an influential city planner working in New York City,

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,840
 in the early 1900s.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,740
 As part of his role,

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,590
 he oversaw the construction of many beautiful parks on Long Island.

12
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,120
 He also oversaw the construction of parkways,

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,590
 roads to bring the people of New York to these parks.

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,920
 That's actually where the word parkway comes from.

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,060
 But something unfortunate happened.

16
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,300
 The bridges along these parkways were too low for buses to pass under them.

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,600
 As a result, public transportation couldn't really run easily to his parks.

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,075
 And as a result of that,

19
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:56,885
 only people wealthy enough to own cars were able to visit his parks.

20
00:00:56,885 --> 00:00:58,815
 What an unfortunate coincidence, right?

21
00:00:58,815 --> 00:01:01,855
 The evidence shows it's anything but coincidence.

22
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:05,765
 Moses intentionally constructed those bridges to be too low for

23
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,140
 buses to pass under.

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,000
 As a way of keeping poor people from visiting his parks.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,740
 His political motivations directly informed the design of

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,100
 the infrastructure and

27
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,920
 the design of the infrastructure had profound social implications.

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,970
 This is an example of winners technology as a form of social order.

29
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,760
 The bridges could have been taller.

30
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,670
 There's nothing inherently political about those bridges.

31
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,080
 It was the way that they were used that accomplished this political motivation.

32
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,040
 As an interesting aside, I learned recently that the design of Central Park

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,070
 inside New York City was an example of the exact opposite dynamic.

34
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,750
 The designers were encouraged to put in places where only carriages could access

35
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,330
 so affluent people would have somewhere to go away from poor people.

36
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,670
 But the designers specifically made the entire park accessible to everyone.

37
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,750
 It's not to hard to imagine things kind of like that happening today either.

38
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,150
 One of the arguments from proponents of Net neutrality is that without it,

39
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,230
 companies can set up fast lanes that prioritize their own content or

40
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,650
 worse severely diminished content of their competitors or

41
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:04,650
 content critical of the company.
