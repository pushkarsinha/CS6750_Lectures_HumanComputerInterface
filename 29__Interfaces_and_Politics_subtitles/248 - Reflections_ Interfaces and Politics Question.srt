1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,750
 You have almost certainly experienced political or

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,670
 business motivations changing the way in which a technology of yours works.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,189
 Similar to the fluorescent light bulb,

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,300
 often times these motivations are to preserve the power or

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,590
 profit of an influential organization in the face of radical change.

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,480
 Sometimes they might be the products of a relationship or an agreement between

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,480
 vendors or organizations to emphasize one another's content.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,250
 Generally, these are instances where technology either performs sub-optimally

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,180
 or has certain features because someone besides the user benefits.

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,140
 So reflect for a second and

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,960
 see if you can think of an instance where some technology you use

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:33,960
 was designed with this kind of political motivation in mind.
