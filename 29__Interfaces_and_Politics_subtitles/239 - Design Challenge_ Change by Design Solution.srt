00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,900
 So here's one idea.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,650
 Imagine a weather tracking app that crowdsourced weather monitoring.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,920
 Every hour participants are buzzed to go outside and let their phone take some

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,620
 temperature readings, maybe take a picture of the sky.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,630
 That design has nothing at all to do with moving around, but

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,329
 that's the side effect of it.

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,280
 Participation in this seemingly unrelated activity

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,360
 has the benefit of getting people moving.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,510
 Pokemon GO is a great example of this in a different context.

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,130
 It doesn't spark the same kind of intermittent exercise but it gets people

11
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:28,130
 to exercise more generally, all without ever actually telling them to do so.
