00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:08,640
 Here are five tips for incorporating value sensitive design into your interfaces.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,220
 Number one, start early.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,070
 Identify the values you want to account for early in

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,820
 the design process and check on them throughout the design process.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,430
 The nature of value sensitive design is that it might have

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,550
 significant connections not just to the design of the interface,

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,550
 but to the very core of the task you're trying to support.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,475
 Number two, know your users.

9
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:31,335
 I know, I say this a lot.

10
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:33,540
 But in order to design with values in mind,

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,885
 you need to know your user's values.

12
00:00:35,885 --> 00:00:37,640
 Certain values are incompatible with

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,355
 one another or at least present challenges for one another.

14
00:00:40,355 --> 00:00:44,885
 Privacy as a value is in some ways in conflict with a value of record-keeping.

15
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:46,355
 To know what to design,

16
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:48,805
 you need to know your user's values.

17
00:00:48,805 --> 00:00:53,345
 Number three, consider both direct and indirect stakeholders.

18
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,400
 We usually think about direct stakeholders.

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,400
 Those are the people that actually use the system that we create.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,600
 Value sensitive design encourages us to think about indirect stakeholders as well.

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,965
 Those are people who do not use the system but who are nonetheless affected by it.

22
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:10,460
 When you're designing the internal system for use by a bank for example,

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,155
 it's used by bank employees,

24
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,815
 but bank customers are likely to be impacted by the design.

25
00:01:15,815 --> 00:01:20,345
 Number four, brainstorm the interface's possibilities.

26
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:25,685
 Think not only about how your design system to be used but how it could be used.

27
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,370
 If you wanted to make a system that made it easier for

28
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,800
 employees to track their hours for example,

29
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,285
 consider whether it could be used by employers to find unjust cause for termination.

30
00:01:35,285 --> 00:01:41,210
 Number five, choose carefully between supporting values and prescribing values.

31
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,825
 Designing for change is about prescribing changes in values.

32
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:48,230
 But that doesn't mean we should try to prescribe values for everyone.

33
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,549
 At the same time,

34
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:51,380
 there are certain values held in the world that we

35
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,210
 would like to change with our interfaces if

36
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:57,205
 possible with regard to issues like gender equality or economic justice.

37
00:01:57,205 --> 00:02:00,755
 Be careful and be deliberate about when you choose to support

38
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:00,755
 existing values and when you choose to try to change them with your interfaces.
