00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,180
 We've talked a good bit about how technology and interfaces can affect

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,340
 politics and culture and society, but we wouldn't be telling the whole

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,130
 story if we didn't close by noting the alternate relationship as well.

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,160
 Political relationships and

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,010
 motivations can often have an enormous impact on the design of technology.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,737
 >From Bijker's book Of Bicycles, Bakelites, and Bulbs, the bulbs part

7
00:00:18,737 --> 00:00:22,960
 refers to the battle of the design of the first flourescent lightbulb in 1938.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,890
 General Electric created a new kind of light that was far more

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,190
 energy efficient.

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,530
 The power companies were afraid that this would reduce power consumption and

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,380
 cut into their profits.

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,500
 After a long drawn out battle involving the Anti Trust Division of the US

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,600
 government and the US Department of War,

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,490
 the fluorescent bulbs that were ultimately sold were not as good as they

15
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,740
 technologically could be in order to preserve others' business interests.

16
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,420
 That issue is more prevalent today than ever.

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,720
 More and more, we see compatibility between devices and usage policies for

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,400
 technologies determined not by what's technologically possible but

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,180
 by what satisfies political or business needs.

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,550
 So here's an example.

21
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,610
 To keep up with everything that I like to watch on TV I have five different

22
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,490
 subscriptions.

23
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:07,630
 I have cable TV, I have Hulu, I have Amazon Prime, I have Netflix and

24
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,220
 I have an HBO subscription on top of my cable subscription.

25
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,270
 And that's not to mention things that I watch for

26
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,980
 free on their own apps like Conan or anything on YouTube.

27
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,090
 And you might think wouldn't it be awesome to just have

28
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,300
 one experience that could navigate among everything I want to watch.

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,170
 And it would be awesome, and there's no technological reason against it.

30
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,280
 But there's a complicated web of ownership and licensing and

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,200
 intellectual property agreements that determine the way that technology works.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,200
 Technology changes society but society changes technology too.
