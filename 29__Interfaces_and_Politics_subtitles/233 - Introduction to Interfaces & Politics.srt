 In 1980, Langdon Winner published a highly influential essay in which he

3
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:12,800
 ask, do artifacts have politics?

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,140
 In other words, do technical devices have political qualities?

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,830
 And the answer is yes.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,430
 All toasters are democrats.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,220
 Thermostats, as you might expect, are members of labor party.

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,140
 And pretty surprisingly automobiles are actually green party members.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,000
 Okay, I'm kidding.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,980
 That's not what we mean when we ask if artifacts have politics.

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,110
 Here, when we say politics we mean whether artifacts can personify specific

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,046
 forms of authority or power, whether for good or bad.

13
00:00:37,046 --> 00:00:40,926
 What we're referring to is the fact that artifacts are interfaces we design,

14
00:00:40,926 --> 00:00:45,650
 change the world around us, just the way politicians or business interests do.

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,870
 Sometimes that's by design, we might design interfaces not for usability,

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,230
 or research, but to create change in the world.

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,850
 Other times that social change happens in ways we didn't anticipate, we design

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,020
 interfaces that are used and affect the world in ways we never anticipated.

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,480
 So in this lesson, we're going to talk about two dimensions of this,

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,220
 designing for change and anticipating the change from our designs.

21
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,980
 We'll also touch on a field that explores these issues more deeply

22
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:10,980
 called Value-Sensitive Design.
