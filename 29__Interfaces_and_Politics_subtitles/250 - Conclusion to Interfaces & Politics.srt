00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,780
 In this lesson, we've discussed the different ways in which interfaces

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,470
 interact with existing power structures or political motivations.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,090
 We looked at how interfaces can have

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,480
 negative repercussions either by design or by happenstance.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,360
 We looked more optimistically at how interfaces can

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,345
 be powerful tools for equality and justice in the world,

7
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:23,835
 whether intentionally or accidentally.

8
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:26,310
 We also looked at how it's important to keep in mind

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,040
 different cultures values while designing interfaces.

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,490
 Now, notice how all of these perspectives hearken back to the idea that

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:32,490
 user experience exists not only in individuals and groups, but in societies.
