1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,300
 One of the challenges with value sensitive design is that values can

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,100
 differ across cultures.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,580
 The internet makes it technologically possible to design single interfaces

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,830
 that are used by people in nearly every country, but just because

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,540
 it's technologically possible doesn't mean it's practically possible.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,020
 And one reason for that is different countries and

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,870
 cultures may have vastly different values.

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,780
 A relatively recent news worthy example of this occurred with

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,750
 the rights to be forgotten.

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,020
 The right to be forgotten is a law in the European union,

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,950
 that allows individuals some control over what information is available about

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,470
 them online.

13
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,460
 That's a value held by the European Union.

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,600
 However, technologies like Google were not generally developed with that

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,640
 value in mind.

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,600
 So there's actually been an extraordinary effort to

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,120
 try to technologically support that right to be forgotten,

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,790
 while still providing search capabilities.

19
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,405
 Making this even more complicated is the fact that

20
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:55,970
 the value isn't universally shared.

21
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,400
 Many people argue that the law could actually effectively become internet

22
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,600
 censorship.

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,720
 So now we start to see some conflict in the values between different cultures.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,900
 One cultures value of privacy,

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,250
 might run a rye of another cultures value of free speech.

26
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,370
 If we're to design interfaces that can reach multiple cultures,

27
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,210
 we need to understand the values of those cultures.

28
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,300
 Especially if it might force us to design different systems for

29
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:19,300
 different people in order to match their local values.
