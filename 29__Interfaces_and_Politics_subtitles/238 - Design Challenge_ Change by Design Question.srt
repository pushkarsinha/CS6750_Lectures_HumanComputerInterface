00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,130
 Let's tackle Change by Design by designing something for Morgan.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,190
 So Morgan has a desk job.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,780
 That means she spends a lot of her time sitting.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,550
 However, for health reasons, it's best for her to get up once per hour and

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,490
 walk around just for a few minutes.

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,290
 There are a lot of way we could tackle this by physically changing the design

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,860
 of her environment to a standing desk or by giving her an app that directly

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,750
 reminds her or rewards her for moving around.

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,630
 But let's try to do something a little bit more subtle.

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,107
 So let's design something for Morgan's smartphone that gets to move around for

11
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:34,260
 a couple minutes every hour without directly reminding her to walk around or

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:34,260
 rewarding her for doing so.
