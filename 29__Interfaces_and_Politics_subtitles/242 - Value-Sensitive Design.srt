1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,510
 In HCI, we describe the idea of interfaces becoming invisible.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,300
 Some of that is a useability principle, but it also applies more broadly

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,060
 to the way that interfaces integrate themselves into our everyday lives.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,580
 And if our interfaces are going to integrate into people's lives,

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,430
 then they need to share the same values as those individuals as well.

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,787
 This connects to the field of value sensitive design.

7
00:00:22,787 --> 00:00:27,373
 The Value Sensitive Design Lab at the University of Washington defines this

8
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:31,456
 idea by saying, value sensitive design seeks to provide theory and

9
00:00:31,456 --> 00:00:34,680
 method to account for human values in a principled and

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,852
 systematic manner throughout the design process.

11
00:00:37,852 --> 00:00:41,475
 In this way, value sensitive design is another dimension to consider when

12
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,220
 designing interfaces.

13
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,740
 Not only is an interface useful in accomplishing a task and

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,760
 not only is it usable by the user, but is it consistent with their values?

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,570
 One of the most well-developed application areas of value sensitive

16
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,190
 design is privacy by design.

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,860
 Privacy is a value, and

18
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,660
 privacy by design has aimed to preserve that value in the design of systems.

19
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,590
 It's possible to design useful usable interfaces

20
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,810
 that don't take privacy into account anywhere.

21
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,470
 That's what makes an examination of user's values an extra dimension

22
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:11,470
 of interface design.
