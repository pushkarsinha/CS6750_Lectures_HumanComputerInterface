00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,670
 This question can have some pretty loaded answers and

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,790
 I encourage you to give those answers.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,490
 But I'm going to give a slightly more innocuous one,

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,110
 exclusivity agreements in video games.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,170
 Imagine I'm a video game developer and Amanda is Nintendo.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,230
 And I'll say hey, Nintendo I'll agree to release my game only on your console,

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,560
 if you agree to promote my game in your console advertisements.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,270
 I benefit from free advertising,

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,520
 Nintendo benefits from getting a selling point for its console.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,100
 There's probably no technological reason my game can't run on other consoles.

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,180
 But there's this business relationship determining the way that the technology

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:32,180
 works.
