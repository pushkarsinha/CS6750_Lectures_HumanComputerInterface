1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,480
 Just as we can create positive changes by accident, if we aren't careful,

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,958
 we can also inadvertently create negative changes as well, or

3
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:10,667
 further preserve existing negative dynamics.

4
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:13,578
 A good example of this is the proliferation of the Internet in

5
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:15,220
 the first place.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,170
 When the Internet first came along, it piggybacked on existing phone lines.

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,610
 Then it started piggybacking on more expensive cable TV lines.

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,210
 And now it's following along with very expensive fiber optic lines.

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,700
 At every stage of the process, areas with more well developed infrastructure

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,990
 get the latest Internet speeds first.

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,240
 However, generally the areas with well developed infrastructure

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,220
 are the wealthier areas in the first place,

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,620
 either because wealthier citizens paid for the improved infrastructure.

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,640
 Or because people with the means to move wherever they want to move,

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,580
 will move somewhere with better infrastructure.

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,830
 High speed internet access is a big economic boon.

17
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,860
 And yet areas that are already economically advantaged

18
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,390
 are generally the first ones to get higher speed internet access.

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,100
 Even today,

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,980
 in poorer parts of the United States the only available Internet connections

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,810
 are slow, unreliable satellite connections with strict data caps.

22
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,621
 And in the rest of the world this issue can be even more profound,

23
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:11,030
 where many areas have no internet access whatsoever.

24
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,560
 And yet, this isn't intentional.

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,925
 Unlike the bridges on Long Island, no one is saying,

26
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:19,480
 let's withhold broadband access from poor people to keep them poor.

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,861
 Instead, it's natural to install better connections where there's already

28
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:24,637
 an existing infrastructure to build on.

29
00:01:24,637 --> 00:01:28,163
 But that very natural plan has profoundly negative implications for

30
00:01:28,163 --> 00:01:30,715
 equitable access to the Internet.

31
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:34,215
 So if we're not careful, completely innocent and completely logical design

32
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:34,215
 ideas can actually perpetuate negative effects in society.
