 Batya Friedman is one of the co-directors of

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,405
 the Value Sensitive Design Research Lab at the University of Washington,

3
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:12,480
 and she co-authored one of the seminal papers on the topic,

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,450
 Value Sensitive Design and Information Systems.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,835
 Friedman, Khan and Borning together provide this excellent paper on the philosophy.

6
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:24,010
 In it, they cover three investigations for approaching value sensitive design.

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,640
 First, the cover conceptual investigations.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,260
 Conceptual investigations are like thought experiments where we explore

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,310
 the role values play in questions like who are the direct and indirect stakeholders,

10
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,225
 and how are both classes of stakeholders affected?

11
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:39,990
 Second, they cover empirical investigations.

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,070
 Empirical investigations go out and use real users,

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,700
 exploring how they make sense of interfaces and answering questions like

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,870
 how do stakeholders apprehend individual values in the interactive context?

15
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,925
 How do they prioritize individual values and usability considerations?

16
00:00:54,925 --> 00:00:57,810
 Third, they cover technical investigations.

17
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,940
 Technical investigations are like empirical investigations that target the systems,

18
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,460
 instead of the users.

19
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,620
 They ask the same kind of questions but they're especially targeting whether or

20
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,100
 not the systems are compatible with the values of the users.

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,570
 The paper also proposes some of the fundamental features of value sensitive design.

22
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,395
 For example, value sensitive design should be proactive

23
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:23,585
 and values sensitive design distinguishes between usability and human values.

24
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:27,535
 If you're playing to work in an area where human values play a significant role,

25
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:30,740
 and I would argue that, that's probably most areas of HCI,

26
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,690
 I highly recommend reading through this paper.

27
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,840
 It can have a profound impact not only on the way you design

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:35,840
 interfaces but on the way you approach user research.
