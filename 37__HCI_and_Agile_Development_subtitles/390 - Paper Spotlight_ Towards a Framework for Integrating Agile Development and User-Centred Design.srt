 In 2006, Stephanie Chamberlain, Helen Sharp, and

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,310
 Neil Maiden investigated the conflicts and

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,260
 opportunities of applying agile development to user-centered design.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,830
 They found interestingly that the two actually had a signficant overlap.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,030
 Both agile development and user-centered design emphasized

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,140
 iterative development processes building on feedback from previous rounds.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,490
 That's the entire design life cycle that we've talked about.

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,410
 That's at the core of both agile development and user-centered design.

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,990
 Both methodologies also place a heavy emphasis on

10
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,440
 the user's role in the development process.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,360
 And both also emphasize the importance of team coherence.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,100
 So it seems that agile methods and user-centered design

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,090
 agree on the most fundamental element, the importance of the user.

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,820
 By comparison, the conflicts are actually relatively light,

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,810
 at least in my opinion.

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,340
 User-centered design disagrees with agile development on the importance of

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,190
 documentation and

18
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,810
 the importance of doing research prior to the design work actually beginning.

19
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,390
 But, clearly, the methodologies have the same objectives.

20
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,710
 They just disagree on how to best achieve them.

21
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,910
 As a result, the authors advocate five principles for

22
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,250
 integrating user-centered design and agile development.

23
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,805
 Two of these were shared between the methodologies in the first place,

24
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:11,630
 high user involvement and close team collaboration.

25
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,177
 User-centered designs' emphasis on prototyping and the design life cycle

26
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:18,503
 shows that by proposing that design is run a sprint ahead of developers to

27
00:01:18,503 --> 00:01:21,940
 perform the research necessary for user-centered design.

28
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:21,940
 To facilitate this, strong project management is necessary.
