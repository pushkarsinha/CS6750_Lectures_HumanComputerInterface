00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:07,830
 Here are five quick tips for using HCI and Agile development together,

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,570
 especially for mitigating the risks to

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,455
 the user experience presented by this more Agile development process.

4
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:16,605
 Number one, start more traditional.

5
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:20,040
 Start with a more traditional need-finding and prototyping process

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,955
 and shift to more Agile development once you have something up and running.

7
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:28,695
 Jacob Nielsen describes this as doing some foundational user-research.

8
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,330
 Once you have something up and running,

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,510
 you have a way of probing the user experience further,

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,060
 but you need something solid to begin with,

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,634
 and that comes from the more traditional process.

12
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:41,050
 Number two, focus on small changes.

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,180
 Notice that when I was doing live prototyping in AB testing,

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,270
 I was making a small change to an existing interface,

15
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,240
 not building an entire new site from scratch.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,245
 Number three, adopt a parallel track method.

17
00:00:54,245 --> 00:00:58,355
 Agile development often uses short two-week sprints and development.

18
00:00:58,355 --> 00:01:03,035
 Under that setup, have the HCI research one sprint ahead of the implementation.

19
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:05,450
 The HCI team can do two weeks sprints of

20
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,665
 need-finding prototyping and low-fidelity evaluation.

21
00:01:08,665 --> 00:01:12,740
 Then, hand the results to the development team for their next sprint.

22
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,805
 Number four, be careful with consistency.

23
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:19,730
 One of our design principles was consistency both

24
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,580
 within our interfaces and across interface design as a whole.

25
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,240
 If your interface caters to frequent visitors or users,

26
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,200
 you'll want to be conservative in how often you mess with their expectations.

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,155
 If you're designing for something like a museum kiosk though,

28
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:35,930
 you can be more liberal in your frequent changes.

29
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,880
 Number five, nest your design cycles in Agile development,

30
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,610
 you go through many small design cycles rapidly,

31
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,505
 and each cycle gives you a tiny bit of new information.

32
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:48,949
 Take all that new information you gather,

33
00:01:48,949 --> 00:01:50,300
 and use it in the context of

34
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,139
 a broader more traditional design cycle aimed at long-term substantive improvements,

35
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:55,139
 instead of small optimizations.
