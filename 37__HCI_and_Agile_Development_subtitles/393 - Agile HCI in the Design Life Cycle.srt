00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 Agile development techniques don't replace the design life cycle,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,010
 they just caffeinate it.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,400
 We're still doing need-finding but we're probably just doing it a little bit more

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,910
 tacitly by reading user feedback or checking out interaction logs.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,890
 We're still brainstorming design alternatives,

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,810
 but we're really just coming up with them in our head

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,180
 because we then immediately move them on to prototyping.

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,020
 Our prototypes are still just prototypes.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,420
 They just happen to work.

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,270
 We're still doing evaluation by rolling our changes out to

11
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,330
 only certain participants first to make sure the respons is good.

12
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,065
 The results of that evaluation then feed the same process over and over again.

13
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:35,585
 So, taking an agile approach to the design lifecycle really doesn't change cycle itself,

14
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:38,030
 it just changes the rate at which we go through it and

15
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,500
 the types of prototypes and the types of evaluation that we actually do.

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,090
 Remember also, the Chamberlain sharpen maiden

17
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,885
 advocated still doing the initial need-finding step.

18
00:00:46,885 --> 00:00:49,490
 Rarely, will we go from no interface at all to

19
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,560
 a working prototype quite as quickly as we go

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,810
 through revisions of those working prototypes.

21
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,440
 So, it's useful to do an initial need-finding phase the way we normally would do it.

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,065
 Then, proceeding to a more agile revision process

23
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:00,065
 once we have a working prototype to actually tweak and modify.
