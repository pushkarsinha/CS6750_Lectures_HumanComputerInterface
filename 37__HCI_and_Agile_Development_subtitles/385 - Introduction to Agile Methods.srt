00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,640
 The content we've covered so far was developed over the course

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,000
 of several decades of research in HCI in human factors,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,445
 and it's all still applicable today as well.

4
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:17,160
 At the same time, new technologies and

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,295
 new areas call for new principals and new workflows,

6
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:25,095
 and specifically, the advent of the Internet ushered in new methods for HCI.

7
00:00:25,095 --> 00:00:30,250
 Many software developers now adopt an agile workflow which emphasizes earlier delivery,

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,060
 more continuous improvement, and rapid feedback cycles.

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,055
 For those of us here in HCI.

10
00:00:35,055 --> 00:00:36,615
 That's actually really exciting.

11
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:38,235
 We love feedback cycles.

12
00:00:38,235 --> 00:00:39,840
 We love building them for our users,

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,910
 and we love engaging in them ourselves.

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,310
 It's also a scary prospect, though.

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,980
 We've discussed long prototyping processes that move from paper to wireframes

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,675
 to live demos involving lots of users in slow qualitative methodologies,

17
00:00:53,675 --> 00:00:55,780
 and those things are still very valuable.

18
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,130
 But, nowadays, sometimes we just want to build

19
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,860
 something really fast and get it in front of real users.

20
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,515
 So, in this lesson, we'll talk about how we might use

21
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:03,515
 agile development methods to engage in quicker feedback cycles.
