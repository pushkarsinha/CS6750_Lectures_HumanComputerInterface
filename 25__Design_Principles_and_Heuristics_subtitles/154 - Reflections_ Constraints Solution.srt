00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,690
 I have kind of an interesting example of this.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,660
 I can't demonstrate it well because the car has to be in motion, but

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,800
 on my Leaf there's an option screen, and it lets you change the time and

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,430
 the date, and some other options on the car.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,680
 And you can use that option screen until the car starts moving.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,730
 But at that point, the menu blocks you from using it,

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,250
 saying you can only use it when the car is at rest.

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,270
 That's for safety reasons.

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,380
 They don't want people fiddling with the option screen while driving.

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,230
 What makes it interesting,

11
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,130
 though, is it's a constraint that isn't in the service of usability,

12
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,030
 it's in the service of safety.

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:29,030
 The car is made less usable to make it more safe.
