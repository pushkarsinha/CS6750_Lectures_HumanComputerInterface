 Over the many years of HCI development, experts have come up with a wide variety

3
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:13,550
 of principles and heuristics for designing good interfaces.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,420
 None of these are hard and fast rules like the law of gravity or something.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,330
 But they're useful guidelines to keep in mind when designing our interfaces.

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,420
 Likely, the most popular and

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,480
 influential of these is Don Norman's six principles of design.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,280
 Larry Constantine and Lucy Lockwood have a a similar set of principles of

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,439
 user interface design, with some overlaps but also some distinctions.

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,720
 Jacob Nielsen has a set of Ten Heuristics for

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,000
 user interface design that can be used for both design and evaluation.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 And while those are all interested in general usability, there also

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,800
 exists a set of seven principles called Principles of Universal Design.

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,720
 These are similarly concerned with usability, but more specifically for

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,028
 the greatest number of people.

16
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:54,720
 Putting these four sets together, we'll talk about 15 unique principles for

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:54,720
 interaction design.
