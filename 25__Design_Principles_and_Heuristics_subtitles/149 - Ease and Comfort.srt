00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,146
 Ease and comfort are two similar ideas that come from the principles of

2
00:00:04,146 --> 00:00:05,179
 universal design.

3
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:07,140
 And they also relate to equitable treatment,

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,030
 specifically in terms of physical interaction.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,750
 The ease principle, which interestingly uses the word comfort, says the design

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:18,040
 can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum amount of fatigue.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,550
 The comfort principle notes that appropriate size and

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,930
 space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation and

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:29,010
 use regardless of the user's body size, posture or mobility.

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,781
 Now, in the past,

11
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:32,781
 these principles didn't have an enormous amount of application to HCI.

12
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:35,618
 Because we generally assume that the user was sitting at their desk with

13
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,240
 a keyboard and a monitor.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,880
 But as more and more interfaces are becoming equipped with computers,

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,870
 we'll find HCI dealing with these issues more and more.

16
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,040
 For example, the seat control in your car might now actually be run be

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,080
 a computer that remembers your settings and

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,250
 restores them when you get back in the car.

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,330
 That's an instance of HCI trying to improve user ease and

20
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,680
 comfort in a physical area.

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,630
 Mobile interfaces are great examples of this as well.

22
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,310
 When deciding the size of buttons on a mobile interface,

23
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,129
 we should take into consideration that some users might have tremors that

24
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,480
 make it more difficult to interact precisely with different buttons.

25
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,690
 As we get into areas like wearable computing and virtual reality,

26
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:10,690
 these issues of ease and comfort are going to become more and more pertinent.
