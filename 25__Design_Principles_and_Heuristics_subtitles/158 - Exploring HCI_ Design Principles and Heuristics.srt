00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,885
 We've talked about a bunch of different design principles in this lesson.

2
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:09,870
 How these design principles apply to your design tasks will

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,870
 differ significantly based on what area you're working in.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,970
 In gestural interfaces, for example,

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,710
 constraints presented a big challenge because we

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,990
 can't physically constrain our users' movement,

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,400
 we have to give them feedback or feedforward in different ways.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,130
 If we're working in particularly complex domains,

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,610
 we have to think hard about what simplicity means.

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,410
 If the underlying task is complex,

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,225
 how simple can and should the interface actually be.

12
00:00:32,225 --> 00:00:36,200
 We might find ourselves in domains with enormous concerns regarding universal design.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,169
 If you create something that a person with a disability can't use,

14
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:41,725
 you risk big problems both ethically and legally.

15
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:44,660
 So, take a few moments and reflect on how these design principles

16
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:44,660
 apply to the area of HCI that you've chosen to investigate.
