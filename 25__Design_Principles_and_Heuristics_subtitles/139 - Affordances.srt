1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,630
 One way to keep design both simple and usable is to

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,410
 design interfaces that by their very design tell you how to use them.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,670
 Don Norman described these as affordances.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:14,205
 The design of the thing affords or hints at the way it's supposed to be used.

5
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:17,535
 This is also similar to the familiarity principle from Dix et al.

6
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:20,070
 This is extremely common in the physical world because

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,300
 the physical design of objects is connected to the physical function that they serve.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,130
 Buttons are meant to be pressed,

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,645
 handles are meant to be pulled,

10
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:29,190
 knobs are meant to be turned.

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,405
 You can simply look at it and understand how you're supposed to use it.

12
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:36,625
 Our next principle is the principle of affordances.

13
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:41,420
 Norman writes, "An affordance is the relationship between the properties of an object and

14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,535
 the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used.

15
00:00:46,535 --> 00:00:48,995
 In other words, an object with an affordance,

16
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:51,575
 basically tells the user by its very design,

17
00:00:51,575 --> 00:00:53,330
 how it's meant to be used."

18
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,220
 I use a door handle as the icon for this,

19
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,695
 because the door handle is a great example of an affordance.

20
00:00:57,695 --> 00:00:59,570
 You can look at it and understand that you're

21
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,675
 probably supposed to pull it down or push it up.

22
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:03,010
 The very design of it,

23
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,835
 tells you how you're supposed to use it.

24
00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:06,200
 Norman goes on to say that,

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,960
 "The presence of an affordance is jointly determined by

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,865
 the qualities of the object and the abilities of the agent that is interacting".

27
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:16,925
 In other words, an affordance for one person isn't an affordance for everyone.

28
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:18,920
 If you didn't grow up around door handles,

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,080
 then maybe that door handle doesn't have an affordance

30
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,615
 for you the way it would for someone who grew up around that.

31
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:26,910
 Our affordances are defined by who the user is.

32
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,870
 The challenge is that in the virtual computer world,

33
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,580
 there's no such inherent connection between

34
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,190
 the physical design and the function of an interface,

35
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,125
 the way you might often find in the real world.

36
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:39,440
 For example, when I mouse over a button in my interface,

37
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,770
 the style that appears around it makes it look like it's elevated.

38
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,380
 It makes it look like it's popping out of the interface.

39
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,695
 That affords the action of then pushing it down,

40
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:51,850
 and I know that I need to click it to push it down.

41
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,360
 When I click it, it depresses. It gets darker.

42
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,120
 It looks like it's sunk into the interface.

43
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,245
 So, here we've manually created an affordance that would exist in the real world.

44
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,500
 The design of this button hints at how it's supposed to be used.

45
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,800
 It hints at the fact that it's supposed to be pressed.

46
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,930
 So, we have to create that naturalness manually.

47
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,405
 We can do that in a number of different ways.

48
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:15,005
 We could, for example, visualize the space of options.

49
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:17,430
 Here this color picture does a good job of this.

50
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,680
 The horizontal line, it actually shows us the list of options available to us.

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,890
 The placement of the dial suggest where we are now,

52
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,990
 and there's this kind of implicit notion that I could

53
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,575
 drag the style around to change my color.

54
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:33,080
 We can also leverage metaphors or analogies of physical devices.

55
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,885
 You can imagine that as this content was presented like a book,

56
00:02:35,885 --> 00:02:39,320
 I might scroll through it by flicking to the side, as if it's a page.

57
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,650
 You may have seen interfaces that work exactly like that.

58
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,880
 There's no computational reason why

59
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,555
 that should mean go to the next page or that should mean go back a page,

60
00:02:47,555 --> 00:02:51,545
 except that it makes sense in the context of the physical interface it's meant to mimic.

61
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:53,015
 We swipe in a book,

62
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:55,645
 so let's swipe in a book like interface.

63
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:59,660
 Of course, there are also actions in the virtual world that have no real-world analogy,

64
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,090
 like pulling up a menu on a mobile site.

65
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,655
 In that case, we might use signifiers.

66
00:03:04,655 --> 00:03:07,930
 Signifiers are a principle in Norman's more recent additions.

67
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,565
 Signifiers are in-context instructions

68
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,165
 like arrows to indicate which way to swipe for a particular action,

69
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:18,895
 or in this case, a button labeled menu to indicate how to pull up a menu.

70
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:20,780
 In this way, we can kind of create

71
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,630
 our own affordances by creating an intuitive mapping between

72
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,610
 controls and their effects in the world

73
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:25,610
 being consistent with what others have done in the past.
