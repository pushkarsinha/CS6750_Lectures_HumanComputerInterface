1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,750
 Norman takes us a step further though,

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,040
 when he breaks down constraints into four sub-categories.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,730
 These aren't just about preventing wrong input.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,340
 They're also about insuring correct input.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,890
 They're about making sure the user knows what to do next.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,020
 Physical constraints are those that are literally physically prevent you from

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,640
 performing the wrong action.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,080
 A three-prong plug, for

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,690
 example, can only physically be inserted in one way, which prevents mistakes.

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,970
 USB sticks can only be physically inserted one way all the way.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,770
 But the constraint doesn't arise until you've already tried to do it

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,840
 incorrectly.

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,250
 You can look at a wall outlet and

14
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,260
 understand if you're trying to put it incorrectly.

15
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,800
 But it's harder to look at a USB and

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,220
 know whether you're trying to insert it the right way.

17
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,170
 A second kind is a cultural constraint.

18
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,990
 These are those rules that are generally followed by different societies,

19
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,490
 like facing forward on escalators, or forming a line while waiting.

20
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,710
 In designing we might rely on these, but

21
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,770
 we should be careful of intercultural differences.

22
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,530
 A third kind of constraint is a semantic constraint.

23
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,290
 Those are constraints that are inherent to the meaning of a situation.

24
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,980
 They're similar to affordances in that regard.

25
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,270
 For example, the purpose of a rear view mirror is to see behind you.

26
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:11,500
 So therefore, the mirror must reflect from behind, it's inherent to the idea

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,090
 of a rear view mirror, that it should reflect in a certain way.

28
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,000
 In the future that meaning might change,

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,010
 autonomous vehicles might not need mirrors for passengers, so

30
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,250
 the semantic constraints of today, might be gone tomorrow.

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,790
 And finally the fourth kind of constraint is a logical constraint.

32
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,030
 Logical constraints are things that are self-evident based on a situation,

33
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,070
 not just based on the design of something like a semantic constraint,

34
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,420
 but based on the situation at hand.

35
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,930
 For example, imagine building some furniture.

36
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,610
 When you reach the end, there's only one hole left, and only one screw.

37
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,210
 Logically, the one screw left is constrained to go in

38
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,020
 the one remaining hole.

39
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,020
 That's a logical constraint.
