1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,750
 There often exists a tension between discoverability and simplicity.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,039
 On the one hand, discoverability means you need to be able to find things.

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,430
 But how can you find them if they're not accessible or visible?

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,930
 That's how you get interfaces like this with way too many things visible.

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,840
 And ironically as a result, it actually becomes harder to find what you're

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,290
 looking for because there's so many different things you have to look at.

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,230
 This is where the principle of simplicity comes in.

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,810
 Simplicity is part of three of our sets of principles,

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,260
 Nielsen's, Constantine and Lockwood's, and the universal design principles.

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,440
 Nielsen writes specifically about dialogues.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,600
 He says that the dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,200
 or rarely needed.

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,040
 Every extra unit of information competes with the relevant units of information,

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,450
 and diminishes their relative visibility,

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,060
 which we see with all those toolbars Constantine and

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,990
 Lockwood establishes as their simplicity principle.

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,230
 They say the design should make simple common tasks easy.

18
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,000
 Communicating clearly and simply in the user's own language and

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,200
 providing good shortcuts.

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,055
 Universal design is concerned with simplicity as well.

21
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:05,700
 Their principle of simple and intuitive use advocates the use of design

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,010
 easy to understand regardless of the user's experience,

23
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,130
 knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.

24
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,520
 And in this principle you can see universal design's special concern with

25
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,910
 appealing to users of a variety of different levels of expertise, ages,

26
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,360
 disabilities, and so on.

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,120
 Now in some ways, these principles are about designing interfaces but

28
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,230
 they cover other elements as well.

29
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,920
 One example of this is the infamous blue screen of death

30
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,800
 from the Windows operating systems.

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,510
 On the left we have the blue screen of death as it appeared in older

32
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,690
 versions of Windows.

33
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,870
 And on the right we have how it appears now on Windows 10.

34
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,870
 There are a lot of changes here.

35
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,810
 The blue is softer and more appealing.

36
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,280
 The description of the error is in plain language.

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,910
 But the same information is still provided, it's just de-emphasized.

38
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,670
 This is a nice application of Nielsen's heuristic.

39
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,970
 The user should only be given as much information as they need.

40
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,330
 Here, the information that most users would need,

41
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,940
 which is just that a problem occurred and

42
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,790
 here's how close I am to recovering from it, are presented more prominently

43
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,440
 than the detailed information that might only be useful to an expert.

44
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,789
 Another interesting application of simplicity in action came when New York

45
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:13,400
 tried to create simpler signs to represent its allowed parking schedule.

46
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,510
 Navigating the sign on the left is pretty much impossible.

47
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,160
 But it's pretty easy to interpret the one on the right.

48
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,960
 The universal design principle of simplicity is particularly

49
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,760
 interested in whether or not people of different experiences,

50
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,045
 levels of knowledge, or languages can figure out what to do.

51
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:31,545
 Navigating this sign requires a lot of cognitive attention and

52
00:02:31,545 --> 00:02:32,935
 some language skills.

53
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:36,265
 Whereas I would hypothesize that even someone who struggles with English

54
00:02:36,265 --> 00:02:38,765
 might be able to make sense oft the sign on the right.

55
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:40,905
 These two signs communicate the same information, but

56
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:44,475
 while the one on the left requires a lot of cognitive load and language skills,

57
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:47,065
 the one on the right can probably be understood with little effort and

58
00:02:47,065 --> 00:02:47,065
 little experience.
