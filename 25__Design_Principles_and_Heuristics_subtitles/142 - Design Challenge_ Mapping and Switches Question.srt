00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,610
 A good example of the difference between affordances and

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,900
 mappings is a light switch.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,939
 A light switch very clearly affords how you're supposed to use it.

4
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:09,540
 You're supposed to flip it.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,990
 But these switches have no mapping to what will happen when I switch them.

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,990
 I can look at it and clearly see what I'm supposed to do.

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,720
 But I can't tell what the effect is going to be in the real world.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,460
 Contrast with the dials on my stove.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,390
 There are four dials and each is augmented with this little icon

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,130
 that tells you which burner is controlled by that dial.

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,860
 So there's a mapping between the controls and the effects.

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,600
 So how would you redesign these light switches to create not only affordances

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,330
 but also mappings.

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,020
 If relevant, this one turns on the breakfast room light,

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,020
 this one turns on the counter light and this one turns on the kitchen light.
