1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,220
 The principle of flexibility in some ways appears to

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,120
 clash with the principle of equity.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,119
 But both come from the principles of universal design.

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,683
 The principle of flexibility said the design should accommodate a wide range

5
00:00:11,683 --> 00:00:13,721
 of individual preferences and abilities.

6
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:16,436
 But the principle of equity says the design is useful and

7
00:00:16,436 --> 00:00:18,922
 marketable to people with diverse abilities, and

8
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:21,981
 it goes on to say we should provide the same means for all users,

9
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:25,550
 identical whenever possible and equivalent when not.

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,406
 And we should avoid segregating or stigmatizing any users.

11
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:31,999
 Now, in some ways, these systems might compete.

12
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:34,840
 This says we should allow every user to use the system the same way,

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,174
 whereas this one says that we should allow different,

14
00:00:37,174 --> 00:00:40,360
 flexible methods of interacting with the system.

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,180
 In reality, though, these are actually complementary of one another.

16
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,350
 Equity is largely about helping all users have the same user experience,

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,210
 while flexibility might be a means to achieve that.

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,900
 For example, if we want all our users to enjoy using our interface,

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,400
 keeping things discoverable for novice users and efficient for expert users

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,790
 allows us to accommodate a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.

21
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,460
 User experience in this instance means treating every user like they're within

22
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,160
 the target audience and extending the same benefits to all users,

23
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,920
 including things like privacy and security.

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,933
 We might do that in different ways, but

25
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:19,597
 the important note is that the experience is the same across all users.

26
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:21,900
 That's what equity is about.

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,810
 One good example of equity in action are the requirements for password resets.

28
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,356
 We want to design a system so that both expert and

29
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:32,233
 novice users experience the same level of security.

30
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,688
 Security is part of the user experience.

31
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:36,391
 Now, experts, we would assume,

32
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:39,440
 understand the value of a complex password.

33
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,930
 Novices might not.

34
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,370
 So if we don't have requirements around passwords,

35
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,280
 novices might not experience the same level of security as experts.

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,190
 So password requirements can be seen as a way of making sure the user

37
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,880
 experience across novices and experts is the same with regard to security.

38
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,997
 In the process, we might actually frustrate novice users a little bit.

39
00:01:57,997 --> 00:02:01,437
 You could actually see this as a violation of the flexibility principle,

40
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:05,156
 that we're not flexibly accommodating in the kind of interaction that novices

41
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:05,833
 want to have.

42
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,939
 But the important thing, is we're extending the same security benefits to

43
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:11,300
 everyone, and that's equitable treatment.

44
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,050
 And that's also a good example of how at times,

45
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,920
 the different design principles will appear to compete, and

46
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:16,920
 you have to decide what the best approach is going forward.
