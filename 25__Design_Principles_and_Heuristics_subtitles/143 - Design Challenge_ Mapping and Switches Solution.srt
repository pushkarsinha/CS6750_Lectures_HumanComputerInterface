00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,418
 There are a few things we could do actually.

2
00:00:02,418 --> 00:00:05,040
 Maybe we could put a small letter next to each light switch that indicates

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,280
 which light in the room that switch controls.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,310
 K for kitchen, C for counter top, B for breakfast room.

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,250
 Maybe we actually put icons that demonstrates which

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,770
 kind of light is controlled by each switch.

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,150
 So the counter top lights are kind of sconce lights, so

8
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,550
 maybe we put an icon that looks like the counter top lights.

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,950
 But likely the easiest thing is actually the way the system really was designed.

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,989
 I just didn't notice it until I started writing this video.

11
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:30,222
 The lights from left to right in the room are actually controlled by

12
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:32,659
 the light switches from left to right on the wall.

13
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,304
 This switch controls the light over there.

14
00:00:35,304 --> 00:00:38,023
 This switch controls the light right here.

15
00:00:38,023 --> 00:00:40,900
 And this switch controls the light back there.

16
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:40,900
 That actually forms a pretty intuitive mapping.
