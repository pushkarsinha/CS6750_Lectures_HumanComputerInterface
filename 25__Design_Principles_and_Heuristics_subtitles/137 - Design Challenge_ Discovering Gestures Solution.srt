 There's a lot of ways we might do this, from giving her a tutorial in advance,

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,930
 to giving her some tutoring in context.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,590
 For example, we might use the title bar of the phone to just briefly

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,350
 flash a message letting the user know when something they've done could

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,130
 have been triggered by a gesture or a voice command.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,550
 That way, we're delivering instruction in the context of the activity.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,800
 We could also give a log of those so

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,490
 that they can check back at their convenience and

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:20,490
 see the tasks they could have performed in other ways.
