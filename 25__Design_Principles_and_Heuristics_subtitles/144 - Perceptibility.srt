1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,530
 Our next principle is perceptibility.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,973
 Perceptibility refers to the user's ability to perceive the state of

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,300
 the system.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,850
 Nielsen states that the system should always keep users informed about what is

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,450
 going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,040
 That allows the user to perceive what's going on inside the system.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,670
 Universal design notes that the design should communicate necessary information

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,900
 effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,870
 the user's sensory abilities.

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,560
 In other words,

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,630
 everyone using the interface should be able to perceive the current state.

12
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,810
 Note that this is also similar to Norman's notion of feedback.

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,680
 He writes that feedback must be immediate, must be informative, and

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,270
 that poor feedback can be worse than no feedback at all.

15
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,850
 But feedback is so ubiquitous, so general, that really, feedback could be

16
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,010
 applied to any principle we talk about in this entire lesson.

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,590
 So instead we're going to reserve this more narrow definition for

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,080
 when we talk about errors.

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,670
 And our lesson on feedback cycles covers the idea of feedback more generally.

20
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,410
 Things like light switches and oven dials, actually do this very nicely.

21
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,180
 I can look at a light switch and determine whether the system it controls

22
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,650
 is on or off, based on whether the switch is up or down.

23
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,680
 Same with the oven dial.

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,590
 I can immediately see where the dial is set.

25
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,410
 But there's a common household control,

26
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,190
 that flagrantly violates this principle of perceptibility.

27
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,120
 Here's our ceiling fan, you might have one just like it.

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,600
 It has two chains.

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,330
 One controls the light, one controls the fan speed.

30
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,220
 But both only when the switch on the wall is on.

31
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,310
 Now first, the mapping here is awful.

32
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,850
 There's no indication which control is which.

33
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,830
 But worse, the fan chain, which is this one,

34
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,490
 doesn't give any indication of which setting the fan is on currently.

35
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,765
 I don't honestly even know how many settings it has.

36
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:45,846
 [SOUND] I don't know if pulling it makes it go up and then down,

37
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:48,258
 up and then off, down and then off.

38
00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:51,640
 Whenever I use it, I just pull it, wait ten seconds and see if I like the speed,

39
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,340
 and then pull it again.

40
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,040
 And this is all only if the wall switch is on.

41
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,280
 Now, of course people have resolved this with dials or other controls, and

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,310
 yet these dang chains still seem to be the most common approach despite this

43
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:03,310
 challenge of perceptibility.
