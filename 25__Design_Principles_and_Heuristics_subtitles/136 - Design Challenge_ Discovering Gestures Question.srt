Discoverability is one of the challenges
for designing gesture-based interfaces.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,362
To understand this, let's watch Morgan
do some ordinary actions with her phone.

3
00:00:07,362 --> 00:00:24,356
[MUSIC]

4
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:26,804
[SOUND]

5
00:00:26,804 --> 00:00:30,563
[MUSIC]

6
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:33,170
We just saw Morgan do four
things with the phone.

7
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:38,060
Reject a call, take a screenshot,
take a selfie, and make a phone call.

8
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,940
For each of those,

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,280
this phone actually has a corresponding
gesture that would have made it easier.

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,340
She could have just turned the phone
over to reject the call or said, shoot,

11
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,000
to take the selfie.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,875
The problem is that these
are not discoverable.

13
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,645
Having a menu of voice commands kind
of defeats the purpose of saving

14
00:00:52,645 --> 00:00:55,745
screen real estate and simplicity
through gestures and voice commands.

15
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:57,145
So, brainstorm a bit.

16
00:00:57,145 --> 00:00:57,145
How would you make these gesture
commands more discoverable?
