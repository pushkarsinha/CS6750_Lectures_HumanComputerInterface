1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,920
 Finally, Nielsen has one last heuristic regarding user error, documentation.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,820
 I put this last for a reason,

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,920
 one goal of usable design is to avoid the need for documentation altogether.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,230
 We want users to just interact naturally with our interfaces.

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,530
 In modern design, we probably can't rely on users reading our documentation at

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,880
 all unless they're being required to use our interface altogether.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,390
 And Nielsen generally agrees.

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,130
 He writes that even though it's better if the system can be used without

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,810
 documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation.

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,685
 Any such information should be easy to search, focused on user's task,

11
00:00:33,685 --> 00:00:37,565
 list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

12
00:00:37,565 --> 00:00:40,805
 I feel modern design as a whole has made great strides in this direction over

13
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:42,175
 the past several years.

14
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,655
 Nowadays, most often, when you use documentation online or

15
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:48,202
 wherever you might find it, it's framed in terms of tasks.

16
00:00:48,202 --> 00:00:49,772
 You input what you want to do, and

17
00:00:49,772 --> 00:00:52,712
 it gives you a concrete list of steps to actually carry it out.

18
00:00:52,712 --> 00:00:55,242
 That's a refreshing change compared to older documentation,

19
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:58,932
 which was more dedicated to just listing out everything a given interface could

20
00:00:58,932 --> 00:00:58,932
 do without any consideration to what you were actually trying to do.
