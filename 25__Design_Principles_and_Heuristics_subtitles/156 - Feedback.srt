1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,070
 Second, the system should give plenty of feedback so that the user can understand

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,939
 why the error happened and how to avoid it in the future.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:10,403
 Norman writes that feedback must be immediate and it must be informative.

4
00:00:10,403 --> 00:00:13,110
 Poor feedback can be worse than no feedback at all.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,566
 Because it's distracting, uninformative, and, in many cases, irritating and

6
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:18,855
 anxiety-provoking.

7
00:00:18,855 --> 00:00:22,205
 If anything has ever described the classic Windows Blue Screen of Death,

8
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:23,015
 it's this.

9
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:23,935
 It's terrifying.

10
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:24,505
 It's bold.

11
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:25,595
 It's cryptic.

12
00:00:25,595 --> 00:00:28,155
 And it scares you more than it informs you.

13
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:31,387
 Nielsen writes that error messages should be expressed in plain language

14
00:00:31,387 --> 00:00:34,005
 (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and

15
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:36,280
 constructively suggest a solution.

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,010
 Note this tight relationship with recoverability.

17
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,830
 Not only should it be possible to recover from an error,

18
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,040
 the system should tell you exactly how to recover from an error.

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,530
 That's feedback in response to errors.

20
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,310
 For Constantine and Lockwood, this is the feedback principle.

21
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,330
 The design should keep users informed of actions or

22
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,490
 interpretations, changes of state or condition, and errors or exceptions...

23
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,580
 through clear, concise, and unambiguous language familiar to users.

24
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,945
 Again, the old Windows blue screen of death doesn't do this very well.

25
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:06,790
 Because the language is not familiar, it's not concise, and

26
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,230
 it doesn't actually tell you what the state or condition is.

27
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,030
 The new one does a much better job of this.

28
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,770
 Notice as well that Norman, Constantine, and Lockwood are interested in feedback

29
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,760
 more generally, not just in response to errors.

30
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,410
 That's so fundamental that we have an entire lesson on feedback cycles

31
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,280
 that really is more emblematic of the overall principle of feedback.

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,260
 Here we're most interested in feedback in response to errors,

33
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:29,260
 which is a very important concept on its own
