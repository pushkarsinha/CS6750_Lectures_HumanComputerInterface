1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
 It's important to note that the language with which we talk about

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,885
 affordances is famously somewhat imprecise.

3
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:08,610
 Norman's technical definitions of

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,505
 affordances are a little different than what we've used here.

5
00:00:11,505 --> 00:00:16,185
 Affordances to Norman are actually inherent properties of the device.

6
00:00:16,185 --> 00:00:18,985
 For example, a door bar like this one has

7
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:22,995
 the inherent property that the handle moves into the crossbar and opens a latch.

8
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:26,220
 That's the affordance, it's something that inherently does.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,440
 A perceived affordance is a property attributed to the object by a human observer.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,270
 This could be a subtle difference.

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,780
 Here, the perceived affordance would be pushability.

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,120
 Pushing though is a human behavior.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,890
 So, pushability must be

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,480
 a perceived affordance because it relies on someone to do the pushing.

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,410
 What's important is that a perceived affordance can actually be inaccurate.

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,020
 Norman famously complains when doors that are actually

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,765
 meant to be pushed have a handle like this,

18
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:55,735
 which looks like it's supposed to be pulled.

19
00:00:55,735 --> 00:01:01,010
 This is a place where a perceived affordance and an actual affordance are in conflict.

20
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,990
 The user perceives that the store is meant to be pulled,

21
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,860
 but the actual affordance is for it to be pushed,

22
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,375
 or to be more precise,

23
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:12,650
 the actual affordance is that the door opens inward based on these hinges.

24
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,050
 A signifier then is anything that helps

25
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,350
 the perceived affordance match the actual affordance.

26
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,330
 For example, some doors like this will have

27
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,400
 a block bar on the part that's supposed to be pushed.

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,730
 That signifies to a user that this is a place they

29
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,370
 should test out the interaction that they perceive to be possible.

30
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,610
 On the store, we can put a sign that just says, Push.

31
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,520
 That would be a signifier that tries to alleviate

32
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,224
 the conflict between the actual affordance and the perceived affordance.

33
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:40,155
 Now based on these definitions,

34
00:01:40,155 --> 00:01:42,420
 we can't add affordances.

35
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,180
 Affordances are inherent in our system.

36
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,110
 Instead, we can add signifiers that help

37
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,970
 the perception of affordances match the actual affordances that are there.

38
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,470
 With these technical definitions of these terms,

39
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,500
 saying I added an affordance to the interface is like

40
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,380
 saying I added tastiness to that dish or I added beauty to that painting.

41
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,120
 Affordances, tastiness, beauty; these are

42
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,360
 all things that arise as a result of adding signifiers,

43
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,790
 or oregano, or some pretty shade of blue.

44
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:15,340
 But in practice, these distinctions around this vocabulary are often disobeyed.

45
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,330
 It's not uncommon to hear people say,

46
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,610
 I added an affordance here,

47
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,070
 so the user knows what they're supposed to do.

48
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,185
 To me, there's really no harm in that.

49
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:29,495
 The distinctions between these terms are very important when developing a theory of HCI.

50
00:02:29,495 --> 00:02:31,580
 But when you're doing day-to-day design,

51
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,380
 we usually know what we're talking about when we misuse these terms.

52
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,515
 So, I don't think there's any harm in being cavalier about how we use these terms,

53
00:02:39,515 --> 00:02:41,090
 but it is important to know

54
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:41,090
 this distinction in case anyone ever brings up the difference.
