00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,470
 When we started that conversations I commented that when you do HCI right,

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,420
 users won't actually know you've done anything at all.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,960
 Good HCI disappears between the user and the tasks that they're completing.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,310
 As a result, people can underestimate how complex good HCI can be to leverage.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,590
 In this unit, one of my goals has been to help pull back the curtain

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,000
 on all the theories that go on behind the scenes

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,690
 of the designs of some of the interfaces that you use everyday.

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,460
 So as we close this unit, take a second to reflect on the interfaces you use

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,710
 that have disappeared between you and the task.

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,790
 Focus especially on interfaces that were never visible in the first place,

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,960
 not interfaces that became invisible by learning.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,830
 Which of the principles that we've discussed do you now see at play

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,830
 in the design of some of those interfaces?
