00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,890
 One way of knitting together the different ideas of HCI

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,510
 is to start very close and zoom out.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,360
 At the narrowest level,

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,470
 we might view HCI as the interaction between a person and an interface.

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,430
 This is the processor model of the role to human knit system.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,020
 This too looks almost like an interaction between two computers,

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,760
 one just happens to be a human.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,930
 But humans' actions are approached almost computationally.

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,630
 If you're going to take this model, we need to understand a lot about what

10
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,875
 the human can sense, remember, and physically do.

11
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,535
 The model approaches HCI in this manner as well.

12
00:00:29,535 --> 00:00:33,075
 It distills the human's role into goals, operators, methods and

13
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:36,115
 selection of rules, all of which can be externalized.

14
00:00:36,115 --> 00:00:36,115
 But this is a pretty narrow view of HCI.
