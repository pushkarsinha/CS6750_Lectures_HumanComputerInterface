00:00:05,824 --> 00:00:09,268
 In this unit we've talked about the various different design principles that

3
00:00:09,268 --> 00:00:11,940
 have been uncovered after years of research and work in HCI.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,610
 And while they are presented in many ways as individual sets of

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,230
 guidelines and principles, there is a lot of overlap among them.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,050
 So in this recap of the unit,

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,510
 we'll try to tie all these seemingly different threads together.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,680
 We'll also ask you to reflect on how you might apply some of these concepts as

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:27,680
 a whole to certain design problems.
