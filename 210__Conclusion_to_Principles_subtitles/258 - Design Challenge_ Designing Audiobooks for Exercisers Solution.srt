00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,140
 There are a lot of designs that you could propose, but the question here

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,686
 isn't what you design, the question is, how will you develop it?

3
00:00:06,686 --> 00:00:07,806
 How will you evaluate it?

4
00:00:07,806 --> 00:00:10,295
 How do you know which ideas are good and which are bad?

5
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:13,109
 Now we've given some heuristics and principles for doing this, but

6
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:15,502
 that doesn't automatically get you to a good interface.

7
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:18,035
 That just kind of establishes a baseline.

8
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:20,965
 That's just what the principles portion of this course covers.

9
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:23,445
 To fully develop interfaces using these principles,

10
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:23,445
 we need the methods of HCI as well.
