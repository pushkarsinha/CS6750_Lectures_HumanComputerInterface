1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:03,050
 However, that's not all we're interested in.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,220
 We're also interested in how this interaction occurs beyond just

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,700
 the individual and the interface and the task.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,760
 That's what was meant by the participant model of the user.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,790
 The user is not merely interacting with an interface or

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,910
 interacting with a task through an interface.

7
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,630
 They're interacting with other interfaces,

8
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,760
 other individuals and society as a whole.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,970
 They are active participants in the world around them.

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,780
 For example, sometimes we're interested not only in the tasks of the users

11
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,610
 performing, but also in their motivations and reasons for

12
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,440
 performing it.

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,700
 That's what activity theory advocates.

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,090
 Treating the unit of analysis not as a task, but

15
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,740
 as an activity including some elements of the context surrounding the task.

16
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,080
 Other times we're interested in how artifacts and

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,450
 minds combine to help accomplish the task.

18
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,020
 That's what distributing cognition advocates.

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,345
 Or other times we are interested in deeply understanding the situated

20
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:53,079
 context in which a person is acting, that's where situated action comes in.

21
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,390
 And other times, we're interested in how this all integrates with existing social

22
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,180
 norms and social relationships.

23
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,410
 That's what social cognition tries to examine,

24
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,720
 other times we're interested in dynamics even broader than this.

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,400
 Sometimes, we're interested in how the interfaces we design can create positive

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,790
 social change.

27
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,530
 Or sometimes we're interested in how the interfaces we design might

28
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,160
 risk perpetuating existing negative relationships in society.

29
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,930
 That's exactly the goal of some of our design guidelines as well.

30
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,050
 To use interfaces to create a more equal society for all people.

31
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,940
 So this diagram describes from a very low level to a very high level,

32
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:25,940
 what we're interested in throughout this portion of HCI.
