00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,530
 For me, I'm actually using an example of one of these interfaces right now.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,410
 I have a teleprompter in front of me.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,718
 I didn't always use a teleprompter, but as soon as I tried one, I was hooked.

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,137
 And part of that is because of how well designed the interface is.

5
00:00:13,137 --> 00:00:16,707
 The very first time I used it, it made things immediately easier,

6
00:00:16,707 --> 00:00:19,214
 instead of introducing a new learning curve.

7
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:23,367
 First, it uses very simple interactions, quick presses that accomplish anything I

8
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:26,560
 could need during the actual recording process.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,500
 Second, it builds on a good mental model of the task that I'm performing.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,860
 It understands, that while recording, the only things I need to do regularly

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,880
 are pause, play, scroll back, and scroll forward.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,900
 There are a lot of other options that it has but

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,530
 it keeps those out of the way during the actual recording process,

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,280
 because they're not necessary at the time.

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,860
 Personally though, I think the teleprompter is great to analyze from

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,660
 the prospective of distributed cognition.

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,580
 I struggle when recording with talking too fast.

18
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,480
 Without the teleprompter,

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,420
 I have to remind myself to slow down, while also remembering what to say.

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,040
 That's a lot to keep in memory at the same time.

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,980
 The teleprompter lowers the cognitive load involved in remembering what to

22
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,030
 say, but

23
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,290
 it also controls my speed because I can't read what hasn't yet appeared.

24
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,170
 So the teleprompter takes care of two cognitive processes.

25
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,700
 Remembering what I have to say, and

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,150
 monitoring the speed at which I am presenting.

27
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,260
 So the system comprised of the teleprompter and

28
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:17,260
 me is better at recording than I am alone.
