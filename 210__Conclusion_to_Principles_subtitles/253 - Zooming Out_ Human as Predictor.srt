1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,390
 For the most part, we're interested in something more task-focused.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,830
 In fact, this is where we'll likely spend the majority of our time.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,050
 This is the user interacting through some interface to accomplish some task.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,220
 That's what we mean by the predictor model of the user.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,720
 The user is actively involved in looking at the task, making predictions about

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,300
 what to do, and making predictions about what will happen.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,870
 This is where we looked at the gulf of execution and the gulf of evaluation.

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,010
 How hard is is for the user to interact with a task?

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,520
 And how hard is it for them to get feedback on their interaction?

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,530
 Here we also look at how the interface can ideally disappear from this

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,440
 interaction, making the user feel like they're working directly with the task,

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,470
 not interacting with an interface.

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,950
 Now, many of our design principles are constructed specifically to

14
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,980
 help with this.

15
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,440
 To help users more quickly make sense of the interface, and

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,650
 understand the underlying task.

17
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,694
 But in order to design this interaction effectively, we have to understand

18
00:00:47,694 --> 00:00:50,130
 the way the user thinks about the task they're performing.

19
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,230
 We have to understand their mental models and

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,040
 in turn, we have to help make sure their mental models match the actual task.

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,620
 Here we have to get into questions like understanding the user's errors and

22
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,270
 understanding the mapping between representations and

23
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,000
 the understanding tasks.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,260
 We also have to address questions like expert blind spot and

25
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,530
 learned helplessness.

26
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,370
 Now, fortunately, we have a tool to help us with this.

27
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,580
 Cognitive task analysis and its related hierarchical task analysis.

28
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,510
 So much of what we deal with in HCI occurs within this process of a human

29
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:18,510
 completing a task through some interface.
