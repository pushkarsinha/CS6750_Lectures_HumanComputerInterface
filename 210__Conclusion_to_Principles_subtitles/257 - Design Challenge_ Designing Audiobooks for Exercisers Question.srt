00:00:00,445 --> 00:00:02,638
 Let's go back to our original design challenge for

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:04,578
 Morgan from the very beginning of this unit.

3
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:07,501
 We talked about how Morgan wants to be able to listen to audio books on

4
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:11,420
 the go which includes things like leaving bookmarks and taking notes.

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,080
 Using everything we've talked about so far, revisit this problem.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,230
 Start by thinking narrowly about the physical interactions between Morgan and

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,220
 the interface and then zoom out to her interactions with the task as a whole,

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,450
 then zoom out even further to how the interaction between Morgan and

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,375
 the interface or relates to other things going on in the world around here.

10
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:32,110
 And last, think about how interfaces like this

11
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:32,110
 have the potential to effect society itself.
