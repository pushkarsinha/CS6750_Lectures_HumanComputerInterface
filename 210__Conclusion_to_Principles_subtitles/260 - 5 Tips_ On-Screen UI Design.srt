00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,790
 I mentioned in one of our first conversations that

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,850
 this course is distinct from user interface design course.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,510
 We're interested in general principles and general methods for designing interactions

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,410
 between humans and various different kinds of computational devices.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,760
 Designing for traditional screens has its own set of specific principles.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,970
 However, it's quite likely that you'll be designing for this kind of traditional device.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,530
 So, here are five quick tips for designing effective onscreen user interfaces.

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,960
 Number 1, use a grid.

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,230
 Grids are powerful ways of guiding users site around your interface,

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,710
 highlighting important content, grouping together content, and so on.

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,045
 There's a reason why newspapers and magazines have used grid-based layouts for decades.

12
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:44,745
 Number 2, use whitespace.

13
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:48,650
 Users are very good at consuming small chunks of information at a time.

14
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,020
 Notice how news articles often use very short paragraphs and how,

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,775
 why science have lots of whitespace around the text.

16
00:00:54,775 --> 00:00:57,500
 Whitespace works with grids to provide context and

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,470
 guide the user's visual perception of the interface.

18
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,880
 Number 3, know your Gestalt principles.

19
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,090
 Gestalt principles in UI design refer to how users perceive groups of objects.

20
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,030
 It uses group objects together when they're especially close together,

21
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,140
 when they're visually similar,

22
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,555
 when they're moving together, so use that.

23
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:17,365
 Number 4, reduce clutter.

24
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:20,200
 The eye has difficulty processing cluttered information,

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,070
 so reduce clutter wherever possible.

26
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,820
 Grids, whitespace, and Gestalt principles can help with this because they invisibly

27
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,525
 communicate content that might otherwise need to be communicated visually.

28
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:32,030
 Instead of drawing a box to group controls together,

29
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,695
 you can surround them with whitespace.

30
00:01:33,695 --> 00:01:37,250
 Instead of using headers and texts to label different portions of some content,

31
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,755
 you can separate them with a grid and so on.

32
00:01:39,755 --> 00:01:43,195
 Number 5, design in grayscale.

33
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:45,275
 Color can be a powerful tool,

34
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:48,145
 but it also runs array of universal design.

35
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:50,230
 There are enough color blind individuals in the world that

36
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,780
 relying on color too much is really problematic.

37
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,020
 Color can emphasize the content and structure of your interface,

38
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,385
 but it shouldn't be necessary to understand it.

39
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,045
 Take a stoplight, for example.

40
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:01,965
 Red means stop and green means go,

41
00:02:01,965 --> 00:02:05,619
 which is a problem if you're deuteranopic or red-green colorblind,

42
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:09,410
 but the red light is always at the top and the green light is always at the bottom.

43
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,200
 So, even if you are deuteranopic,

44
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,570
 you can still understand what the light is saying.

45
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,460
 Color emphasizes the content,

46
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,355
 but the content doesn't rely on the color.

47
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:21,190
 If you're going to be doing a lot of screen-based UI design,

48
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,560
 I do highly recommend taking a class in the topic.

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,300
 It will cover these principles and a lot more depth,

50
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,480
 give stronger rules for designing good grades and using whitespace,

51
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,190
 and cover one of my favorite topics, typography.

52
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,090
 Amanda can testify that more thought went into selecting the fonts to use

53
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,970
 in this course than nearly any other element of its design.

54
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,650
 If you're curious, it's Ubuntu Condensed for the diagrams and Oswald for the loops.

55
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:42,650
 Well, except that one.
