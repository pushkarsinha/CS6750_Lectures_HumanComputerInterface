1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,890
 Let's do a quick exercise on quantitative versus qualitative data.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,220
 Let's imagine we're doing end of course evaluations for some class.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,950
 For each of the following types of data,

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,280
 mark whether it would be considered quantitative or qualitative.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,270
 You can skip ahead, if you don't want to listen to me read all these out.

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,090
 We have responses to on a scale of 1 to 5, rate this course's difficulty,

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,140
 responses to how much time did you spend per week on this course, responses to

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,475
 what did you like about this course, count of students Students mentioning

9
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:32,255
 office hours to the above questions, percentage of students that completed

10
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:37,575
 the survey, responses to a forum topic requesting non-anonymous course reviews,

11
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:41,425
 the number of participants in a late-semester office hours session, and

12
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:41,425
 the transcript of the conversation of that late-semester office hours session
