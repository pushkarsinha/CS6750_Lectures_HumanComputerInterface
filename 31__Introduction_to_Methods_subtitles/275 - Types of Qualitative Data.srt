1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
 Just as there are different types of quantitative data,

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,055
 so also there are different types of qualitative data.

3
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:08,940
 In practice though, the types of qualitative data we generate are

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,885
 usually much more closely integrated with the way in which they were generated.

5
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:15,210
 For example, we could have discrete ratio data that

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,730
 comes from self-reported responses on a survey,

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,800
 or naturalistic observations in the wild,

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,885
 or logs from real interfaces.

9
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:23,670
 Qualitative data, on the other hand,

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,415
 tends to be determined more by how it's gathered.

11
00:00:26,415 --> 00:00:28,845
 Some common types of qualitative data we'll deal with

12
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:32,300
 are transcripts from things like interviews and focus groups,

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,440
 field notes we might take during naturalistic or participant observation,

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,510
 artifacts like reviews left for

15
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,404
 existing interfaces or the existing interfaces themselves,

16
00:00:41,404 --> 00:00:43,145
 and lots, lots more.

17
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:45,290
 Quantitative data is numeric data,

18
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,885
 and qualitative data is everything else.

19
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:51,870
 So, the span of possible qualitative data is a lot larger.

20
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,380
 The qualitative data is strong because these types of data

21
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,290
 provide a much richer picture of what we're investigating.

22
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,680
 But with that strength comes some costs.

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,470
 Qualitative data is also more expensive to analyze,

24
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,915
 and it's also a lot more prone to interpretation biases.

25
00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:07,760
 So, for that reason, we often convert

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,450
 qualitative data to quantitative data for the purpose of analysis.

27
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,925
 We do this through a process called coding.

28
00:01:13,925 --> 00:01:17,855
 Now here, coding isn't writing Python code or doing anything like that.

29
00:01:17,855 --> 00:01:19,490
 Coding is a process of taking

30
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,340
 free foreign qualitative data and boiling it down into some numeric categories.

31
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,245
 Typically, these categories are nominal,

32
00:01:26,245 --> 00:01:28,550
 which allows us to do whatever kind of statistical test

33
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,220
 we can do on nominal quantitative data.

34
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,245
 During this process, we lose some of that rich data.

35
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:39,320
 But what we gain is a numeric representation that we can use in new ways,

36
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,660
 and plus we didn't really lose that original data.

37
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,720
 It's just not part of the output of this coding process.

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,150
 So, we can still go back and look at it if we need to.

39
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,490
 The other thing that comes out of this process is

40
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,860
 a documented methodology for actually coding the qualitative data to quantitative data.

41
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,840
 So, if anyone asks where we got these numbers,

42
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,140
 we can actually show them the process we went through.

43
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,640
 That helps us argue that our interpretations are not

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,370
 just biased interpretations of what happened,

45
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,895
 but they are actually rigorous analyses based on that qualitative data.

46
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:11,855
 In HCI., we almost always want to use some mix of these two.

47
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:15,920
 Our problems are far too rich to address with quantitative data alone,

48
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,510
 but for that same reason,

49
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,510
 we risk being dominated by biases if we focus solely on qualitative analysis.
