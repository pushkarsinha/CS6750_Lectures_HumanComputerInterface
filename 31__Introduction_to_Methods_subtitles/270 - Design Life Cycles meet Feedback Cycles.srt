00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,740
 When we talk about feedback cycles,

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,160
 we talk about how they're ubiquitous across nearly every field.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,700
 And each CI itself, isn't any different.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,810
 In a feedback cycle,

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,460
 the user does something in the interface to accomplish some goal.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,395
 And then judges based on the output from the interface,

7
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:20,025
 whether the goal was accomplished, then they repeat and continue.

8
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:21,831
 In HCI, we're brainstorming and

9
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:24,204
 designing interfaces to accomplish goals.

10
00:00:24,204 --> 00:00:27,193
 And then based on the output of our evaluations, we judge whether or

11
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,868
 not the goals of the interface were actually accomplished,

12
00:00:29,868 --> 00:00:31,780
 then we repeat and continue.

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,140
 In many ways, we're doing the same things that our users are doing,

14
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,700
 trying to understand how to accomplish a task in an interface.

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,380
 Only in our case, our interface is the tools to build and

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:42,380
 evaluate interfaces and our goal is to help them accomplish their goal.
