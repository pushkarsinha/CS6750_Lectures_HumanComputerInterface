00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,160
 When we talk about user-centered design,

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,310
 we throw around the word user as if it's pretty obvious what it means.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,010
 The user is the person who uses the interface that we create, right?

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,724
 However, that's not the only person in whom were interested.

5
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:15,076
 There are multiple stakeholders in this design,

6
00:00:15,076 --> 00:00:19,080
 and we want to explore how our design is going to affect all of them.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,560
 The user themselves is what we call the primary stakeholder.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,360
 They're the person who uses our tool directly.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,750
 Secondary stakeholders are people who don't use our system directly, but

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,460
 who might interact with the output of it in some way.

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,640
 Tertiary stakeholders are people who never interact with the tool or

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,450
 even interact with it's output, but

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,592
 who are nonetheless impacted by the existence of the tool.

14
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:42,710
 So let's take a couple of examples of this.

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,850
 Imagine we're designing a new grade book tool that makes it easier for

16
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,410
 teachers to send progress reports to parents.

17
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,300
 Teachers would interact with the tool, inputting grades and feedback.

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,200
 And so teachers would be our primary stakeholders.

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,830
 Parents receive the output of that tool.

20
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,760
 Parents receive the progress reports.

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,870
 And so they're secondary stakeholders.

22
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,750
 They interact with the output of the system, but not with the system itself.

23
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,260
 Students don't use the system at all,

24
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,820
 and maybe they don't even see the progress reports unless parents decide

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,330
 to share them.

26
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,030
 But they're nonetheless affected by the existence of this system.

27
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,185
 So they're tertiary stakeholders.

28
00:01:15,185 --> 00:01:18,335
 School administrators might be another stakeholder, but where they fall in

29
00:01:18,335 --> 00:01:21,375
 this would differ based on how the school sets up the relationship.

30
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,365
 If they can use the tool to directly monitor and

31
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:26,457
 intervene in student progress, they might be primary stakeholders.

32
00:01:26,457 --> 00:01:28,367
 If they just see aggregated progress reports so

33
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:31,577
 they can monitor things, they might be secondary stake holders.

34
00:01:31,577 --> 00:01:33,580
 If they never interact with the system in any way,

35
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,454
 they're nonetheless likely affected by the fact the system is there.

36
00:01:36,454 --> 00:01:38,967
 And so they'd be tertiary stakeholders.

37
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:43,430
 In designing this tool, we need to keep all three kinds of stakeholders in mind.

38
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,180
 For example, how does parents having more consistent

39
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,656
 access to great information affect the students?

40
00:01:48,656 --> 00:01:52,306
 It might foster increased involvement by parents, but it might also facilitate

41
00:01:52,306 --> 00:01:56,118
 helicopter parenting, where parents are too controlling over their kid's school

42
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:59,664
 work and prevent them from developing the necessary metacognitive skills and

43
00:01:59,664 --> 00:02:02,265
 self discipline that they need to succeed later in life.

44
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:06,446
 User-centered design isn't just about catering to the user in the center of

45
00:02:06,446 --> 00:02:07,475
 this diagram, but

46
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:07,475
 it's also about looking at the impact of our designs on all the stakeholders.
