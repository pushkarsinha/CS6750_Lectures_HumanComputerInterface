1
00:00:00,498 --> 00:00:03,330
 User centered design is about integrating the user into

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,490
 every phase of the design life cycle.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,240
 So, we need to know two things.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,280
 What the design life cycle is and how to integrate the user into each phase.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,770
 Now if you look up design life cycles you'll find a lot of different ideas.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,660
 We're going to discuss in terms of a four phase design life cycle that's

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,110
 pretty general and probably subsumes many of the other ones you'll find.

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,425
 The first part of this is Needfinding.

9
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:29,855
 In Needfinding, we gather a comprehensive understanding of the task

10
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:31,765
 the users are trying to perform.

11
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,205
 That includes who the user is,

12
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:36,145
 what the context of the task is, why they're doing the task, and

13
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:39,437
 any other information related to what we're designing.

14
00:00:39,437 --> 00:00:42,577
 Second, we develop multiple design alternatives.

15
00:00:42,577 --> 00:00:47,047
 These are very early ideas on the different ways to approach the task.

16
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,187
 It's important to develop multiple alternatives to avoid getting stuck in

17
00:00:50,187 --> 00:00:51,960
 one idea too soon.

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,920
 The third step is prototyping.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,870
 We take the ideas with the most potential and we build them into

20
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,510
 prototypes that we can then actually put in front of a user.

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,640
 Early on we might do this in very low fidelity ways like with a paper and

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,460
 pencil, or even just verbally describing our ideas.

23
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,470
 But as we go on we refine and improve.

24
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,930
 Fourth, and most importantly, we perform user evaluation.

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,390
 We take our ideas that we prototyped and put them in front of actual users.

26
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,110
 We get their feedback, what they like and what they don't like, what works and

27
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,120
 what doesn't work, and then the cycle begins anew.

28
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,830
 The feedback we gain from the users,

29
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,990
 as well as our experience with these prototypes and

30
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,850
 design alternatives, improves our understanding of the problem.

31
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,780
 We now know new areas of the problem we might need to explore with some more

32
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,270
 need finding.

33
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,920
 Now we might have some new ideas for design alternatives, or

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,970
 some new ways of expanding the designs that we already have.

35
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,860
 We then take those things and use them to improve our prototypes.

36
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,120
 Either prototyping new ideas that we didn't have before, or

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,630
 making our prototypes more rigorous and more polished,

38
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,060
 so that we can get even better evaluation.

39
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,540
 And then we put them in front of users again.

40
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,490
 Each time we go through this cycle our understanding improves,

41
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,100
 our designs improve, and our prototypes improve.

42
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,630
 Eventually our prototypes develop to the point of being designs ready for

43
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,070
 launch, but the cycle doesn't end there.

44
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,070
 We keep iterating, now with live users doing the evaluation.
