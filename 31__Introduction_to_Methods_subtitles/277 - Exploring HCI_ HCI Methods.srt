00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,550
 Over the past several lessons,

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,130
 you've been exploring how the design life cycle applies to

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,490
 the area of HCI that you chose to explore.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,665
 Now that we've reached the end of the unit,

5
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:16,785
 take a moment and reflect on the life cycle that you've developed.

6
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:19,980
 How feasible would it be to actually execute, what would you need?

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,870
 What users do you need?

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,970
 How many? When do you need them?

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,700
 There are right answers here, of course.

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,310
 Ideally you'll need users early and often.

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,590
 That's what user-centered design is all about.

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,650
 In educational technology, that might mean having some teachers,

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,810
 and students, and parents that you can contact frequently.

14
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,070
 In computer-supported cooperative work,

15
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,065
 that might mean having a community you can visit often to see the new developments.

16
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:48,350
 In ubiquitous computing, that might mean going as far as having someone who specializes

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,120
 in low fidelity 3D prototypes to quickly spin up new ideas for testing.

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,855
 Now that you understand the various phases of the design life cycle,

19
00:00:56,855 --> 00:00:59,990
 take a moment and reflect on how you use them iteratively

20
00:00:59,990 --> 00:00:59,990
 and as a whole in your chosen area of HCI.
