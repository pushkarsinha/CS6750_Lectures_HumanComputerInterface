1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,910
 Within the general category of quantitative data,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,100
 there are a number of different subdivisions.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,010
 These are important because they inform what kind of conclusions we

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,040
 can generate and what kind of statistical test we can perform.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,220
 We'll talk about statistics more when we talk about evaluation,

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,620
 but it's important to understand what type of data you're

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,755
 gathering during all phases of the design lifecycle.

8
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:23,925
 So, first, there are four major distinctions in quantitative data: nominal,

9
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:26,775
 ordinal, interval, and ratio data.

10
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:30,250
 Nominal data is also referred to as categorical data.

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,960
 It arises when we observe the number of instances of different categories.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,225
 So, for example, if we asked a bunch of users,

13
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:38,060
 how do you typically commute to work?

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,235
 These would each be different categories.

15
00:00:40,235 --> 00:00:43,595
 Our data would be the number of people that fell into each category.

16
00:00:43,595 --> 00:00:46,730
 Ordinal data is similar to nominal data,

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,815
 but there's some explicit ordering to those different categories.

18
00:00:50,815 --> 00:00:53,750
 So, for example, we might ask on a scale of 1-5,

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,840
 how would you rate your level of satisfaction with your commuting method?

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,970
 The user would choose highly dissatisfied,

21
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,605
 dissatisfied, neutral, and so on.

22
00:01:00,605 --> 00:01:01,970
 These are still categories,

23
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,450
 but there's an ordering to them.

24
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,350
 But, what's important here is that we don't actually

25
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,300
 know how big the gaps between these categories are.

26
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,230
 It could be that users perceive only a small difference between

27
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,510
 neutral and satisfied or only a small difference between satisfied and highly satisfied.

28
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,480
 They might perceive the difference between satisfied and highly satisfied as smaller,

29
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,605
 for example, than the difference between dissatisfied and highly dissatisfied.

30
00:01:24,605 --> 00:01:26,495
 That's where interval data comes in.

31
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:30,760
 With interval data, we do know the exact difference between values.

32
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,260
 Imagine if we asked commuters at what time do you leave for work in the morning?

33
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,680
 We know that the difference between 6:00 AM and 8:00

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,920
 AM is the same as the difference between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM.

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,010
 So, the interval between the different options is the same,

36
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,685
 but that can still lead to some strange comparisons.

37
00:01:45,685 --> 00:01:48,495
 8:00 AM isn't twice as late as 4:00 AM.

38
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:51,560
 It's four hours later, but just because eight is twice as much as four,

39
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,395
 it doesn't mean 8:00 AM is twice as late as four 4:00 AM.

40
00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:56,590
 We know the intervals between the numbers,

41
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,395
 but we don't know their ratios.

42
00:01:58,395 --> 00:02:00,875
 We often talk about this in the context of temperature.

43
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:06,305
 Sixty-four degrees isn't twice as warm as 32 degrees even though 64 is twice 32.

44
00:02:06,305 --> 00:02:09,170
 With interval scales, there is no zero-point,

45
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,080
 only intervals between numbers.

46
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,495
 That brings us to the fourth kind of quantitative data, ratio data.

47
00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:18,320
 Ratio data is just like interval data except it has a zero point.

48
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,945
 So, that means we can actually use ratios.

49
00:02:20,945 --> 00:02:23,690
 If we ask our commuters how long it takes them to get to work,

50
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,135
 we know that someone who says 30 has twice as long a commute as someone who says 15,

51
00:02:28,135 --> 00:02:30,925
 and 15 is twice as long as 7.5, and so on.

52
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:33,920
 So, those are our four general types of quantitative data.

53
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,385
 But, there are more subcategories that come up among these two.

54
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:39,380
 For example, with nominal data,

55
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,945
 we can have single nominal and multi-nominal data.

56
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:46,880
 Our question here is can a person being more than one category at the same time?

57
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,260
 Earlier when we had this question,

58
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,850
 we phrase it as single nominal.

59
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,670
 We ask users to choose only one of these options,

60
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,860
 but it would be entirely possible to have users who take

61
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,320
 different forms of transportation on a regular basis.

62
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,495
 So, why force him to choose only one.

63
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:02,840
 With multi-nominal data we might let them choose more than one option.

64
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,205
 So, any given user can fall into multiple categories.

65
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:07,950
 If you read about quantitative data,

66
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,220
 you'll see that ordinal data can also be-multi ordinal.

67
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,770
 But, to be honest, I've never seen a compelling example of when that might happen,

68
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,640
 so I'm not going to show one here.

69
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,155
 With nominal data, we can also have binary and non-binary data.

70
00:03:20,155 --> 00:03:22,715
 This distinction is a little bit more straightforward.

71
00:03:22,715 --> 00:03:25,055
 The example we've already shown is non-binary.

72
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:26,990
 There's more than two different options.

73
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,470
 Binary nominal data has only two categories.

74
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,510
 This might seem like a silly distinction,

75
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,330
 but it's actually important because the type of statistical tests we do with

76
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,640
 binary data are a little bit different from

77
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,435
 the types of statistical tests we do with non-binary data.

78
00:03:40,435 --> 00:03:44,930
 This distinction between binary and non-binary data can also apply to ordinal data.

79
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,300
 Non-binary ordinal data is pretty straightforward.

80
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,300
 It's a one to five scale or a one to seven scale or anything like that.

81
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,505
 But, we can still have ordinal binary data.

82
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:55,400
 For example, what grade did you earn in driver's ed.

83
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,970
 We would interpret an implicit ordering between Fail and Pass.

84
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,305
 So, that would make an ordinal data,

85
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:02,975
 but there's still only two options, so it's binary data.

86
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:04,775
 With both interval and ratio data,

87
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:07,795
 there's also a distinction between discrete and continuous.

88
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:09,680
 Discrete means it's something countable.

89
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,840
 So, if we ask how long is your average commute in minutes,

90
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,880
 we're generally expecting people to give an answer in a whole number.

91
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,910
 We're not expecting someone to say it takes 15.245 minutes.

92
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,025
 So, that would be discrete.

93
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:23,880
 It's a countable number of minutes.

94
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,120
 If, on the other hand,

95
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,480
 we were to put sensors in people's cars and actually time how long their commutes are,

96
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,230
 we would arrive at continuous data.

97
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:36,110
 We would get values like it takes on average 31.2513 minutes for you to commute,

98
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,350
 and just like that distinction between binary and non-binary data,

99
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:44,125
 these distinction sometimes informs the type of statistical tests we're supposed to use.

100
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,400
 So, these are general categories of

101
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,420
 quantitative data as well as some smaller distinctions that might be relevant.

102
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,300
 In practice I can share that actually I find relatively

103
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,290
 few times in our work where we use interval data.

104
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,210
 Using when we're dealing with real numbers,

105
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,730
 we're dealing with numbers that have a zero-point like time or number of occurrences.

106
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,705
 Similarly, the type of statistical tests that we use for

107
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,750
 interval and ratio data are almost always the same.

108
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,610
 We similarly use some of the same tests for nominal and ordinal data.

109
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,465
 But, I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit.

110
00:05:14,465 --> 00:05:14,465
 For now, what's most important is just to understand what kind of data you're collecting.
