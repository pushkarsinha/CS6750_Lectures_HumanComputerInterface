00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,880
 At every stage of this design life cycle, we're interested in gathering

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,350
 information from the user to better inform our designs.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,960
 To do that, we need a number of methods to actually obtain that information.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,840
 Fortunately, there are a number of methods we can employ to try to gather

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,590
 the information we need.

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,285
 And in fact,

7
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:20,780
 the majority of this unit will go through all these different methods.

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,780
 These will become the tools in your toolbox.

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,810
 Things you can call upon to grab the information you need when you need it.

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,970
 Not the many of this method are so well-developed that you can cover them

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,610
 in the entire units, or even entire courses.

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,185
 For example, we'll spend about three or

13
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:36,354
 four minutes talking about naturalistic observation.

14
00:00:36,354 --> 00:00:38,224
 And yet, there are entire textbooks and

15
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:41,770
 courses on how to do naturalistic observation really well.

16
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,380
 The goal of this is to give you enough information to get started and

17
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,680
 enough to know what you need to explore next.

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,960
 Remember, one of the original goals of this class was not just to understand

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:51,960
 more HCI but also to understand how big the field of HCI actually is.
