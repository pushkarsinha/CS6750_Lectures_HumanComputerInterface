1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,524
 I encountered this in my first job, actually.

2
00:00:01,524 --> 00:00:04,819
 Somewhere between my freshman and sophomore years at Georgia Tech,

3
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:09,000
 I had a job as a user interface designer for a local broadcast company.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,950
 I designed an interface, then I handed it over to a team of engineers for

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,380
 implementation.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,548
 Late in the process, the requirements were changed a bit and new configuration

7
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:19,251
 screen was needed that the engineers just went ahead and looked up.

8
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:22,562
 We got the finish tool and it all worked beautifully and perfectly,

9
00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:24,547
 except for this configuration screen.

10
00:00:24,547 --> 00:00:26,836
 It was a list of over 50 different settings,

11
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:29,018
 each with 3 to 5 radio buttons to the side.

12
00:00:29,018 --> 00:00:30,652
 Each setting was a different length.

13
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:32,313
 Each radio button label was a different length.

14
00:00:32,313 --> 00:00:34,548
 There was kind of placed all over the campus.

15
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:35,284
 There was no grid.

16
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:36,396
 It was illegible.

17
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:40,170
 It was unusable, but it was technically functional.

18
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,420
 It met the requirements described in terms of what the user must be able to

19
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,390
 do, just not how usable it was.

20
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,860
 Fortunately, there's a greater appreciation of the value of

21
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,420
 user-centered design now than there was then.

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,730
 So, many spaces have become so

23
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,480
 crowded that the user experience is what can really set a company apart.

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,856
 I've actually been noticing a trend lately toward new user experiences

25
00:00:59,856 --> 00:01:01,079
 around really old tasks.

26
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,640
 I use an app called stash to buy and sell small amounts of mutual funds.

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,548
 Buying mutual funds has been around forever and

28
00:01:06,548 --> 00:01:08,847
 E-Trade has even been doing that online for a long time.

29
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:12,455
 What differentiates stash is the new user experience.

30
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:15,930
 Automated investing, simple tracking, simplified summaries.

31
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,899
 User experience design really has become a major differentiator between

32
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:19,899
 success and failure.
