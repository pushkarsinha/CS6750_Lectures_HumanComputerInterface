1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,740
 You might actually come from a software engineering background, and so

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,570
 while user-centric designs sounds obvious to some people,

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,020
 you might have experienced the other side of the coin.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,480
 In many industries and domains,

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,200
 software engineers are still left to design user interfaces themselves.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,690
 There's a fantastic book about this called The Inmates Are Running

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,530
 the Asylum, by Alan Cooper.

8
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,040
 Where he compares technology to a dancing bear at a circus.

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,700
 He notes that people marvel at the dancing bear,

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,240
 not because it's good at dancing, but because it dances at all.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,100
 The same way, people marvel at certain pieces of technology not

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,520
 because they work well, but because they work at all.

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,830
 The book was released in 2004 and since then the user has become more and

14
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,780
 more a focal point of design.

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,720
 And yet there is still places where individuals with little ACI background

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,550
 are designing user-facing interfaces for one reason or another.

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,300
 Since it's a stronger chance you've worked in software engineering,

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,770
 reflect on that a bit.

19
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,310
 Have you seen places where software engineers, data scientists, or

20
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,420
 even non-technical people were put in charge of designing user interfaces?

21
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:55,420
 How did it go?
