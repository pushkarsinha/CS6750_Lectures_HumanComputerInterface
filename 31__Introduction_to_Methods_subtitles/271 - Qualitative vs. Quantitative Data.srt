1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,170
 There is one final distinction we need to understand going forward

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,730
 because it's going to come up at every stage of the design lifecycle,

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,580
 qualitative versus quantitative data.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,150
 At every stage of the design lifecycle,

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,860
 we're interested in gathering data from users.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,633
 Early on that might be descriptions of what they do

7
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:17,078
 when they're interacting with a task.

8
00:00:17,078 --> 00:00:20,555
 Or it might be measures of how long certain tasks take to complete,

9
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:24,030
 or how many people judge a task to be difficult.

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,590
 Later on, though, it might be whether or not users prefer our new interfaces or

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,390
 how much better they perform on certain tasks.

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,794
 Now data will always fall into one of two categories, qualitative and

13
00:00:33,794 --> 00:00:34,607
 quantitative.

14
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:37,689
 Quantitative is probably the easier one to describe,

15
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:40,505
 quantitative data describes anything numeric.

16
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:44,205
 When data is summarized numerically, we can perform statistical tests and

17
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:46,574
 summaries on it, draw formal conclusions, and

18
00:00:46,574 --> 00:00:48,100
 make objective comparisons.

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,380
 Now there are a lot of strengths of quantitative data, but

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,990
 those strengths come in large part because quantitative data only

21
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,060
 captures a narrow view of what we might be interested in examining.

22
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,202
 It's very strong for a very small class of things.

23
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:04,733
 Qualitative data covers pretty much everything else.

24
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:08,050
 Qualitative Data covers descriptions, accounts, observations,

25
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,240
 it's often in natural language.

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,630
 It could be open ended survey responses, or interview transcripts, or

27
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,690
 bug reports or just your personal observations.

28
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,270
 Because of its flexibility, qualitative data gives us a much broader and

29
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,760
 more general picture of what we're examining.

30
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,960
 But the cost is that it's hard to generate formal conclusions based on

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,540
 qualitative data.

32
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,580
 Qualitative data may be more prone to biases.

33
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,790
 Now in some circumstances,

34
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,560
 we can convert qualitative data into quantitative data.

35
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,080
 For example,

36
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,360
 we could count the number of surveys respondents to an end of course survey

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,325
 who mentioned course difficulty in their free response questions.

38
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:45,470
 Now the free response question would be qualitative data but

39
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,220
 numerically summarizing it generates quantitative data.

40
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,990
 Generally speaking, though, quantitative data and

41
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,580
 qualitative data serve different purposes in a design life cycle.

42
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,781
 I've heard it described quantitative data provides the what,

43
00:01:57,781 --> 00:02:00,282
 the qualitative data provides the how or the why.

44
00:02:00,282 --> 00:02:03,194
 When performing need finding or when doing some initial prototype

45
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:07,042
 evaluations, we're likely interested in users' qualitative descriptions of their

46
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:09,174
 tasks or their experiences with the interface.

47
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:12,386
 It's generally only after a few iterations that we start to be

48
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:17,470
 interested in quantitative analysis, to find numeric improvements or changes.

49
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,340
 We can also use these in conjunction with one another, collecting both

50
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,230
 quantitative and qualitative data from the same participants.

51
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,910
 That's referred to as a mixed method approach, it's a mix of qualitative and

52
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,910
 quantitative data to paint a more complete picture of the results.
