1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 We then moved on to direct manipulation,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,200
 which was one way to create interfaces with very short goals of execution and evaluation.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,650
 Direct manipulation involved creating interfaces where the user felt like

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,190
 they were directly interacting with the object of the task.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,190
 Instead of typing commands or selecting operators,

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,270
 they would more physically participate with the interface.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,430
 The goal of this, and really of any good interface design,

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,295
 was to create interfaces that become invisible.

9
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:29,250
 Invisible interfaces are those that allow the user to focus

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,775
 completely on the task instead of on the interface.

11
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:35,070
 We noted that nearly any interface can become

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,010
 invisible when the user has enough practice and expertise,

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:38,010
 but our goal is to create interfaces that vanish sooner by good design.
