1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
 We're discussing human computer interaction and that

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,700
 means we have to understand the human portion of the equation.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,630
 So, we also took a crash course toward some basic psychology.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,990
 We broke the human down into three systems: perception,

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,345
 cognition and the motor system.

6
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:19,020
 With perception, we covered the strengths and limitations of the visual,

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,015
 auditory and kinesthetic senses.

8
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:25,215
 We discussed how each of them can be useful for different kinds of information.

9
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:28,560
 Then, we discussed some of the limitations to human cognition.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,190
 We focused a lot on memory,

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,469
 how many things we can store at a time and how things can be stored more permanently.

12
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,440
 We also discussed the notion of cognitive load.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,300
 We focused especially on how we should use

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,255
 our interfaces to reduce the user's cognitive load.

15
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:45,470
 Finally, we discussed the limitations of the human motor system,

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,885
 especially how those limitations change with

17
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:51,155
 age or in the presence of certain distractions.

18
00:00:51,155 --> 00:00:52,820
 We're designing for humans,

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:52,820
 so these limitations and advantages are key to how we design our interfaces.
