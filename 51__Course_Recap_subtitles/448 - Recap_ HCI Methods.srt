00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
 The Design Principles unit of the course cover the fundamental principles

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,140
 and ideas developed over decades of work in this space,

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,150
 but we can't create good interfaces just by applying old principles to new problems.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,255
 Those old principles can help us make progress much faster,

5
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:16,800
 but to design good interfaces,

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,700
 we have to involve the user.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,770
 That's perhaps the most important principle of HCI, user-centered design.

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,300
 User-centered design advocated keeping the user at

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,880
 the heart of all of our design activities.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,670
 For us, that isn't just the person using the tool,

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,725
 but it's also all the people affected by the tool's very existence.

12
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:37,315
 So, to keep the user in mind,

13
00:00:37,315 --> 00:00:39,860
 we use an iterative design life cycle that focuses on

14
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,785
 getting feedback from the user early and often.

15
00:00:42,785 --> 00:00:42,785
 The methods of that life cycle were the core of the Methods unit of this course.
