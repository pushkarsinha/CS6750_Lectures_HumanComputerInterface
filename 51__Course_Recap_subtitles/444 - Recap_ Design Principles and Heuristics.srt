00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
 Human-computer interaction has a long and rich history,

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,530
 initially drawn from human factors engineering before becoming a field of its own.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,870
 During that history, it's developed lots of

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,840
 principles and heuristics for how to design good interfaces,

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,415
 lots and lots and lots in fact,

6
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:16,705
 literally thousands of principles.

7
00:00:16,705 --> 00:00:20,010
 In this lesson, we covered 15 of the most significant ones,

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,380
 drawn from four sets of design principles.

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,665
 We covered the principles of Don Norman, Jakob Nielsen,

10
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:30,390
 Larry Constantine, Lucy Lockwood and the Center for Universal Design.

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,570
 Among these, I would probably argue that the most significant principles to

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,310
 remember where affordances, mappings, and constraints.

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,800
 Affordances are parts of the interface that by their very design,

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,670
 tell the user what they should do.

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,240
 A good mapping then tells the user what the effect of that interaction will likely be,

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,055
 and then constraints ensure that the user only chooses to do the correct things.

17
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:53,510
 With those three combined,

18
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,315
 as well as the other heuristics that we covered,

19
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:55,315
 we can create interfaces that vanish between the user and the task very quickly.
