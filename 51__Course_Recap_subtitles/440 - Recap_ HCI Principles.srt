1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,570
 Our first unit was the unit on design principles.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,310
 To start that unit off, we'd began by investigating the process of identifying a task.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,029
 We discussed how a task is not just the actions that a user performs,

4
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:14,460
 but it's the combination of their motivations,

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,980
 and their goals, and their context, and so on.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,920
 We emphasized that we're not just interface designers,

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,454
 we are task designers.

8
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:26,645
 We design tasks and then we create interfaces that make those tasks possible.

9
00:00:26,645 --> 00:00:30,650
 We then explored three views on the user's role in a particular task.

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,990
 We might view them as an information processor,

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,150
 like another computer in the system.

12
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,699
 We might view them as a predictor, or interpreter,

13
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:40,795
 someone operating a mental model of the system.

14
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:43,185
 We might view them as a participant,

15
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:47,165
 someone working in a larger context beyond just our interface.

16
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:47,165
 And then, finally, we discussed how the views we take inform the designs we create.
