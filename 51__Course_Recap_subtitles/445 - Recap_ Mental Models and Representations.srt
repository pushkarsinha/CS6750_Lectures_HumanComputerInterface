1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
 Every one of our users has some mental understanding of

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,035
 their task as well as where our interface fits into that task.

3
00:00:06,035 --> 00:00:07,780
 We call that their mental model.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,060
 They use that mental model to simulate and predict the effects of certain actions,

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,240
 that's why we call this the predictor model of the user.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,820
 Our goal is for the user's mental model to match

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,355
 the reality of the task in the interface.

8
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:22,680
 To accomplish that, we try to design

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,055
 representations with clear mappings to the underlying task.

10
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:28,320
 That's how we can ensure that the user's mental model of

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,455
 the system is both accurate and useful.

12
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:36,270
 We discussed here mistakes which are errors that occur based on inaccurate mental models,

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,065
 and we discussed slips which are errors that occur despite accurate mental models.

14
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:43,640
 We also talked about a couple of the challenges that can

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,865
 arise in trying to help users build accurate mental models.

16
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:49,250
 One of those was called expert blind spot,

17
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,140
 that occurs when we lose sight of

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,745
 our own expertise and we forget what it's like to be a novice.

19
00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:57,010
 The other was learned helplessness,

20
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,490
 which is when users learn that they have

21
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,905
 no real ability to accomplish their goals because of a broken feedback cycle.

22
00:01:02,905 --> 00:01:06,500
 In designing representations that lead to accurate mental models,

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:06,500
 we need to make sure to avoid both of these problems.
