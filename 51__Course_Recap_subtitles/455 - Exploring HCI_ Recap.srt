00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,640
 Over the course of our conversations,

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,860
 I've asked you to revisit the area of

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,740
 HCI in which you're most interested during each topic.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,790
 I've asked you to brainstorm how the various design principles and theories,

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,950
 apply to the area that you chose.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,430
 I've asked you to think of how a design lifecycle might be created,

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,845
 that addresses that chosen application area.

8
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:26,880
 We've also given you lots of information to read about your chosen topic.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,895
 You have all the tools necessary to start developing.

10
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:29,895
 I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with.
