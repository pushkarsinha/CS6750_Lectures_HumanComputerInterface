00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,430
 We've reached the end of our HCI course.

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,075
 To close things off, let's briefly recap what we've covered.

3
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:16,560
 The purpose of this lesson isn't just to give you an inventory of the course content.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,740
 The real reason for this lesson is to give us

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,080
 an excuse to have this cool inception effect over here.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,225
 No, really, it's to repeat

7
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:26,695
 all that content again to load it into your working memory one more time.

8
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:30,920
 After all, we know that the more often you load some content into short-term memory,

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,660
 the more strongly it remains in long-term memory.

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,500
 That was a principal we learned in the lesson on human abilities,

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,300
 and it covers where we start and end

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,635
 every lesson by repeating the material that we covered.

13
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:46,400
 Each repeat loads it into your short-term memory one more time, further solidifying it.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,035
 So, to close this course,

15
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:49,430
 we'll do this one more time.

16
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,010
 Although we hope, you'll come back again and again

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,010
 and watch some of the material whenever you need a refresher.
