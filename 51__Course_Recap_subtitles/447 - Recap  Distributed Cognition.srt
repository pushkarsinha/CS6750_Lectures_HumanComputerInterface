00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
 Earlier, we discussed the idea of cognitive load.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,410
 Cognitive load was the principle that humans have a set amount of cognitive resources,

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,680
 and if there are overloaded and their performance suffers and they get frustrated.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,010
 So, how do we reduce the user's cognitive load?

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,095
 Well, we can make the task easier, sure,

6
00:00:16,095 --> 00:00:19,125
 but we can also add to their cognitive resources.

7
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,670
 That's the principle of distributed cognition.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,515
 The interactions of humans and artifacts together

9
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:27,985
 have more cognitive resources in individuals acting alone.

10
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:31,160
 Devices and interfaces can exhibit cognitive properties like

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,880
 memory and reasoning offloading those needs from the user.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,420
 We also discussed three related theories: social cognition,

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,060
 situated action, and activity theory.

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,460
 All three of these put a strong emphasis on

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,640
 the context of a task whether it be the physical context,

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:46,640
 the social context or the societal context.
