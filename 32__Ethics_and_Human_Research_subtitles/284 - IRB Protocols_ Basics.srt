1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,378
 Generally speaking,

2
00:00:01,378 --> 00:00:04,252
 you might not ever be asked to complete a protocol yourself.

3
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:07,410
 You might instead just be added to an existing protocol.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,378
 Still, you need to make sure to understand the procedures outlined by

5
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:13,668
 any protocol to which you're added, because they still govern what you do.

6
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:17,464
 So we'll run through the process of creating a protocol, but this will also

7
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:20,870
 cover the details to know about any protocol to which you are added.

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,735
 So for this,

9
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:26,475
 I have a draft protocol covering our user study on people who exercise.

10
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:29,325
 Every protocol starts with the title of the protocol, and

11
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:30,730
 some certified personnel.

12
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,345
 These are required just to save the protocol.

13
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:37,146
 We add approved research personnel on the study personnel page.

14
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:40,353
 We would enter their name, select their role, and

15
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:45,364
 if their certification isn't already in the system, we would attach it here.

16
00:00:45,364 --> 00:00:47,690
 After adding them, they'll appear down here.

17
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,598
 The primary investigator, PI, must always be added first and

18
00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:53,376
 it must be a faculty member.

19
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:57,205
 The protocol description covers the study at a high level.

20
00:00:57,205 --> 00:00:59,732
 This should briefly touch on what will be done,

21
00:00:59,732 --> 00:01:03,404
 what the goal of the research is and what subjects will be asked to do.

22
00:01:03,404 --> 00:01:05,937
 It doesn't cover all the details, but it covers enough for

23
00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:09,039
 someone to understand generally what we're going for with this study.

24
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:12,054
 Under the research design and methodology section,

25
00:01:12,054 --> 00:01:13,599
 we describe our research.

26
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,290
 First, we describe the research design in the methodology.

27
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,051
 With human subjects research,

28
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:21,453
 this focuses on what users will experience and in what order.

29
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:24,886
 It also covers some experimental details like how subjects might be assigned

30
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:26,643
 different experimental conditions.

31
00:01:26,643 --> 00:01:30,901
 Then we describe the duration of subject participation to make sure subjects

32
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:32,873
 aren't being asked to do too much.

33
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:37,245
 Depending on what we're doing, we may need to provide data collection methods.

34
00:01:37,245 --> 00:01:41,340
 This includes things like surveys, pre-tests and post-tests interview

35
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,306
 scripts, anything pre-prepared to elicit data for the participant.

36
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:48,045
 Then we also need to fully describe the potential benefits of the study.

37
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:51,625
 Remember, IRB is about making sure that the benefits out way the risks.

38
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:55,310
 If there are no benefits, then the benefits can't out way the risks.

39
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,423
 Benefits don't need to be to the individual participants though,

40
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:00,887
 but they could be to the greater community as a whole.

41
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:04,903
 Similarly, we also needed to describe the risks associated with the study.

42
00:02:04,903 --> 00:02:06,104
 For usability studies,

43
00:02:06,104 --> 00:02:08,800
 very often our risks are not going to be very significant.

44
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,439
 Our risks might be those associated with normal work at a computer.

45
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,354
 But we still need to address this to acknowledge that we thought about what

46
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:17,740
 risks might arise to participants.

47
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,248
 Then we describe the plan for the statistical analysis if we have one.

48
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:23,930
 Qualitative research might not have a statistical analysis plan, so

49
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,890
 that's why I've left this blank.

50
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,191
 Finally, we need to describe start and end dates of the research.

51
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,373
 Very often, this will break the research into a data collection phase and

52
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:35,567
 a research phase, where we actually analyze the data that we collected.

53
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:38,780
 Now we won't generally need to worry about many of the remaining options on

54
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,279
 this form, because we're not doing clinical studies and

55
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:44,900
 we generally don't have external funding unless you're working on a professor's

56
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,782
 research project.

57
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:45,782
 So now let's move on to subject details.
