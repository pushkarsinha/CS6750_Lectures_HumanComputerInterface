1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,040
 Institutional review boards govern any research institutions

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,230
 that receive support from the federal government.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,150
 But what about research that doesn't receive any federal support?

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,850
 Very often, companies will do research on their users.

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,100
 This is especially common in HCI.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,040
 Lots of companies are constantly doing very interesting testing on

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,370
 their users with a lot of rapid AB experiments.

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,580
 There's a lot of potential knowledge there, but at the same time

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,740
 much of what they do likely would not pass IRB if it were university research.

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,400
 This actually came up recently with Facebook in a paper they

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,030
 published titled experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,850
 through social networks.

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,750
 Basically, Facebook wanted to see if they could predict what would make

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,560
 users happy or sad.

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,790
 And as a result they tweaked the news feed for

16
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,210
 some users to test out their ideas.

17
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,970
 In other words, they tried to manipulate their user's mood for

18
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,910
 experimental purposes.

19
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,770
 Now, Facebook argues that this was consistent with their

20
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,310
 own data use policy, which permits them to perform experiments like this.

21
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,120
 Some social scientists however would argue that this does not constitute

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,600
 informed consent.

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,930
 Informed consent they say is specific to a certain experiment, temporary for

24
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,150
 a known period of time and given without coercion.

25
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,350
 Some would argue that if you don't agree you can't use Facebook

26
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,150
 qualifies as coercion.

27
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,860
 These are some difficult issues and if you end up working in HCI industry,

28
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:22,860
 you'll likely find yourself wrestling with some of them.
