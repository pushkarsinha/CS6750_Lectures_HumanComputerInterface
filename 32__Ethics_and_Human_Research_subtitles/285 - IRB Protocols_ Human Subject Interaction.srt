1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,620
 Because we're interested in human-computer interaction,

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,100
 we almost certainly will have human-subject interaction.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,820
 So when it asks, will the research involve direct interaction with human

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,540
 subjects, we would click, yes.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,174
 That will bring us to a screen where we describe our subjects and

6
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:15,775
 the data we plan to collect from them.

7
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:19,570
 First, they want to know how many subjects we have and what genders.

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,448
 They want to make sure that we're not wasting participants' time if we're not

9
00:00:22,448 --> 00:00:23,942
 going to actually analyze all their data.

10
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:26,310
 And that we're being fair to the different genders.

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,360
 A common problem in early research was over-representing male populations.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,780
 Second, they'll want to know if we're targeting any vulnerable populations.

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,160
 People that might not have the capacity to give true informed consent.

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,880
 If we do, we need to make special accommodations to make sure they're

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,475
 fully aware of their rights as participants.

16
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:45,845
 Third, they want the scientific justification for

17
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,105
 the number of subjects to enroll in our study.

18
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:50,635
 Like I said, they want to make sure that we're not going to waste the time of

19
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:53,345
 a bunch off participants and then just throw their data out.

20
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:56,215
 That wouldn't be very respectful for our participants' time.

21
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:59,465
 If we're doing statistical tests this might be the number of participants

22
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:01,355
 necessary to find a certain effect size,

23
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:04,440
 which we'll talk about when we talk about quantitative research.

24
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,860
 If we're doing qualitative research, this is usually a smaller number and

25
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,590
 is more based on how many different perspectives we need

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,220
 to get a good picture of what we're trying to analyze.

27
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,040
 Alternatively, we might have external limits on our number of participants.

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,100
 For example, if you're doing classroom research,

29
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,670
 your maximum number of students is the maximum number of students in the class.

30
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,990
 Next, we state the inclusion and exclusion criterion.

31
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,300
 The inclusion criterion are, who we specifically including,

32
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,940
 who's our targeting audience?

33
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,480
 The exclusion criterion are those that we're specifically excluding.

34
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,860
 Often times, one of these will just be the inverse of the other, but

35
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,100
 there may be times when we need to be more specific.

36
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,890
 For example, if we were doing research on undergraduate computer science

37
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,060
 education, our inclusion criteria might be undergraduate students.

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,920
 But our exclusion criteria would be undergraduate students that have

39
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,920
 previously taken a computer science class.

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,969
 As before, we can skip the questions, for our purposes at least,

41
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,934
 that are more based on clinical research.

42
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:02,715
 But at the bottom, we need to provide the steps necessary to ensure additional

43
00:02:02,715 --> 00:02:06,330
 protection of the rights and welfare of vulnerable populations.

44
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:06,900
 For example,

45
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,990
 if we're working with 10 year olds, how do we make sure 10 year olds really

46
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,590
 understand that they really do have the right to opt out of this research?

47
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,820
 We need to provide a plan for

48
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,010
 that here if we're working with a vulnerable population.

49
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,250
 Finally, we also need to describe our recruitment procedures.

50
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,700
 How are we going to find our subjects?

51
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,300
 First, we'll note what we'll say and how we'll communicate with them here.

52
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,500
 If we're using the Georgia Tech subject pool, which is a system for

53
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,360
 finding research subjects within the Georgia Tech student body,

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,160
 we'll indicate so here.

55
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,920
 And last,

56
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,110
 we'll note the kind of compensation we plan to provide the participants.

57
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,621
 Many times we won't compensate our participants at all.

58
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:44,603
 But if we're doing a bigger research study that actually has some external

59
00:02:44,603 --> 00:02:47,868
 funding, it's pretty normal to give them some sort of monetary compensation for

60
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,110
 participation.

61
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,540
 It's we're using the George Tech subject pool, our compensation will often be

62
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,200
 extra credit in a certain class, very often a psychologist class.

63
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,450
 Note that the recruitment procedures are very important,

64
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,660
 especially if you're doing something like classroom research, where there

65
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,220
 can be a very significant perception of coercion to get people to participate.

66
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,120
 If I, as an instructor, am recruiting students in my own class

67
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,890
 to participate in my research project, I have to be very clear

68
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:12,890
 that it won't come back to haunt them if they choose not to participate.
