1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,570
 One of the most important elements of IRB approval is consent,

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,720
 that was one of the things created by the Belmont Report.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,290
 If we're doing any interaction with our human subjects,

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,070
 we definitely need to think about consent procedures.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,270
 On the consent information page, first,

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,640
 we need to indicate what kind of consent we'll receive.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,640
 Most commonly, this will be written consent required.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,730
 In this case, participants will sign or digitally sign,

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,060
 a consent form to start the study, but in some cases a waiver may be obtained.

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,790
 First, a waiver of consent can be obtained under certain,

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,680
 pretty narrow circumstances,

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,910
 this generally means we don't need to receive the subject's consent at all.

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,840
 Most of the time this only applies when subjects will not be directly

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,430
 affected by the research.

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,840
 So for example, if we wanted to study educational or

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,310
 health data that's already been generated and

17
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,710
 is already anonymized, we might receive a waiver of consent.

18
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,470
 Because those subjects won't be impacted by the fact we're now

19
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,990
 researching their data.

20
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,122
 Similarly, if we were to go sit in a coffee house and just take notes on

21
00:00:58,122 --> 00:01:01,039
 the order taking process in a way that didn't identify anyone.

22
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,944
 We might receive a waiver of consent,

23
00:01:02,944 --> 00:01:06,710
 because our observation is not affecting those people.

24
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,290
 We might also receive a waiver of documentation of consent.

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,960
 This occurs for low risk research, where the written consent itself,

26
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,570
 would be the only record of the participants identity.

27
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,420
 This applies to a lot of survey research or unrecorded interviews,

28
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,280
 where participants can be informed of their rights at the start, and

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,950
 their own continued participation constitutes continued implied consent.

30
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,210
 There's no reason to have them sign a consent form, because that consent form

31
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,110
 is the only reason we'd ever be able to identify them after the study.

32
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,210
 After selecting our option,

33
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,600
 we need to provide a justification, if we requested a waiver.

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,400
 If we didn't, then no justification is necessary.

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,730
 We'll then describe the plan for obtaining informed consent.

36
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,700
 Generally, this will be to provide the consent form to participants

37
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,180
 at the start of a study, and

38
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,260
 make it very clear that they can withdraw from the study at any time.

39
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,750
 If we're involving children, non english speakers or other at risk

40
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,390
 populations in our study, there may be some additional boxes to complete.

41
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,410
 It's also important for

42
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,600
 us to assess whether participants are continuing to consent to the study.

43
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,660
 Often times, we do this by making it very clear at the start of the study

44
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,460
 that they can withdraw at any time.

45
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,550
 So that their continued participation constitutes implied continued consent.

46
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,880
 Finally, it's also possible to have protocols where deception or

47
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,850
 concealment is proposed.

48
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,340
 In HCI, for example, we might want to tell participants that an interface is

49
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,555
 functioning even if someone behind the scenes is actually just making it look

50
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:31,155
 functional, so that we get good research data out of those participants.

51
00:02:31,155 --> 00:02:34,565
 For example, if we were testing something like a new version of Siri,

52
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:36,735
 we might tell participants that it's functioning,

53
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:40,225
 when in reality someone is writing the responses by hand.

54
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:44,245
 If we're using deception or concealment like that, we'll indicate so here.

55
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:47,590
 Then finally, we need to upload our consent forms.

56
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,540
 At Georgia Tech the Office of Research Integrity Assurance provides consent

57
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,420
 form templates that we can tweak to match the specific needs of our study.

58
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,860
 The templates provide in depth directions on what to supply.

59
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,260
 Generally, this is where we disclose to participants the details of the rest

60
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,260
 of the protocol.

61
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:03,260
 What we're researching, why, how, and why they were invited to participate?
