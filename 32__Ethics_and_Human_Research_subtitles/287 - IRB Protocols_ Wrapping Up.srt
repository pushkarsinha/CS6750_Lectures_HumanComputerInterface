1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,510
 Of the remaining fields the only one we're likely interested in is

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,420
 the data management questions.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,074
 The majority of the others cover either clinical research or

4
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:10,690
 biological research or other things that we

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,320
 hopefully won't touch on very much in human computer interaction.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,680
 Unless the field has changed a lot by the time you're listening to this.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,490
 Nonetheless though you should actually peek into the items to make sure that

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,400
 they don't apply to you if you're filling out a protocol like this.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,730
 Under the Data Management section,

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,180
 we'll want to describe how we keep participants data safe.

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,160
 That'll include descriptions of the way we store it and

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,580
 define information about participants.

13
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,200
 And how we'll safeguard the data itself through password protection or

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,030
 encryption or anything like that.

15
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,200
 Finally, there are always some questions that we answer for

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,180
 all studies even though they generally won't apply to us.

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,050
 Generally our studies won't involve the Department of Defense,

18
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,140
 generally they shouldn't involve Radiation.

19
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,000
 And one day I really kind of hope they involve Nanotechnology but

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,830
 we're probably not quite there yet.

21
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,100
 So we'd mark no that there is no DoD involvement.

22
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,174
 Finally, at the bottom, there's a place to upload some additional documents.

23
00:00:58,174 --> 00:01:01,869
 This is where we would supply things like an interview script, a survey,

24
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:05,565
 a recruitment script and other documents that the IRB would want to see and

25
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,114
 approve.

26
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:09,757
 When we're done, we can click Save and Continue Application.

27
00:01:09,757 --> 00:01:13,040
 On the next page, we can preview everything on one flat screen,

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,100
 and then check off at the end that we have no conflicts of interest, or

29
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,000
 report them, if we do.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,290
 Then we'll click Save & Continue again.

31
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,420
 And for y'all, you would then submit it to your primary investigator.

32
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,000
 I am the primary investigator so

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,810
 I see something a little bit different here than what you would see.

34
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,340
 After submission, we'll generally hear back from IRB in about three weeks about

35
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:32,340
 whether the study was accepted and what changes need to be made if not.
