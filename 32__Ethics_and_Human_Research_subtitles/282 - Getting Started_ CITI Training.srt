00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,060
 If you're going to be doing a research just part of a University project or

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,150
 University class, you need IRB approval.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,119
 Different universities have different processes and

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,380
 policies for getting started with IRB.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,240
 We're going to discuss the Georgia Tech policies and sets where these class is

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,590
 based but you should check with your university if you're from somewhere else

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,820
 to make sure you're following the right policies for your school.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,880
 To get started, we need to complete the required training.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,640
 So here I'm showing the IRB website,

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,660
 which is researchintegrity.gatech.edu/irb.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,640
 And to get started, you need to complete your required training.

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,980
 So click required training over on the left.

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,440
 This'll take you to a page that overviews the IRB required training and

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,380
 gives you a link of the left to begin your CITI training.

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:45,380
 So click that, then login to your Georgia Tech account.

16
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,920
 And you're going to want to complete Group 2, Social and

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,800
 Behavioral Research Investigators and Key Personnel.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,400
 I can't show you exactly what it looks like to sign up fresh because I've

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,560
 already completed it.

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,740
 But you should be able to add a course and add that as your course.

21
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,550
 After you've completed CITI training you'll receive your completion report

22
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:00,550
 and then you'll be ready to get started with IRB.
