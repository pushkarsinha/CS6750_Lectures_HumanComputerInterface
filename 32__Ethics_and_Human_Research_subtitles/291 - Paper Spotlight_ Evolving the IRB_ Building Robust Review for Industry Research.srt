 In a recent paper, in The Washington and Lee Law Review,

2
00:00:06,735 --> 00:00:08,430
 Molly Jackman and Lauri Kanerva,

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,580
 two Facebook employees explored exactly this issue.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,250
 Jackman and Kanerva specifically note that

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,609
 the ethical guidelines developed in the context of academia,

6
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,925
 do not always address some of the considerations of industry.

7
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:24,225
 In response, the authors directly advocate for setting up

8
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:27,840
 a set of principles and practices for industry environments.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,100
 In other words, rather than just ignoring the parts that aren't relevant for industry,

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,345
 the authors advise creating a new set of standards specifically for industry.

11
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:40,470
 To do so, Facebook designed its own internal review process.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,550
 In this case, Facebook's process is heavily

13
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,090
 reliant on deferring to a research area expert.

14
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,250
 I don't say defer in a bad way.

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,010
 A key part of IRB is that experiments are reviewed by

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,175
 people with no incentive to permit the study if it isn't ethical.

17
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:57,890
 Facebook tries to replicate this by referring studies to

18
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,405
 an external reviewer who in turn decides whether or not an additional review,

19
00:01:02,405 --> 00:01:05,659
 and even external IRB is necessary.

20
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:07,970
 The other thing that's important to note though,

21
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,645
 is that Facebook isn't under any strong obligation to do this.

22
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:15,980
 Universities that receive federal funding are governed by the Belmont Report,

23
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,390
 but companies are not yet governed by any similar law.

24
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,515
 So we rely on companies to govern themselves.

25
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,880
 In Facebook's case, it seems to be going pretty well,

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,280
 but you might find yourself at a company that doesn't have

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,280
 such a program and you'll have to apply these standards yourself.
