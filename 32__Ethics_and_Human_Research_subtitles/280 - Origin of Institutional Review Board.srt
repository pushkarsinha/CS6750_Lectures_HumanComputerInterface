00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,110
 In the first half of the 20th century,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:06,580
 a number of pretty clearly unethical human subjects experiments took place.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,102
 Many of them were conducted by scientists working for

4
00:00:09,102 --> 00:00:10,846
 the Axis powers during World War II.

5
00:00:10,846 --> 00:00:14,204
 But famously, many were also conducted right here in our own backyard,

6
00:00:14,204 --> 00:00:15,477
 here in the United States.

7
00:00:15,477 --> 00:00:19,281
 Among them were Milgam's obedience experiment where participants were

8
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:22,225
 tricked into thinking that they had administered lethal

9
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:26,320
 shocks to other participants to see how obedient they would be.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,172
 There was the Tuskegee syphilis study where rural African American men were

11
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:34,084
 intentionally injected with syphilis to study its progression and there was

12
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:38,239
 the Stanford prison experiment where participants were psychologically abused

13
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,291
 to test their limits or test how they would act under different circumstances.

14
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:46,839
 In response to all this, the National Research Act of 1974 was passed,

15
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:50,890
 which led to the creation of institutional review boards to oversee

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,610
 research at universities.

17
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,781
 The Belmont Report further summarizes basic ethical principals that research

18
00:00:56,781 --> 00:01:00,420
 must follow in order to receive government support.

19
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,500
 Among other things, the law dictated that the benefits to society must

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,446
 outweigh the risks to the subjects in the case of these experiments.

21
00:01:08,446 --> 00:01:11,378
 It also dictated that subjects must be selected fairly,

22
00:01:11,378 --> 00:01:14,505
 which was a direct response to the Tuskegee syphilis study.

23
00:01:14,505 --> 00:01:16,152
 And perhaps most importantly,

24
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:19,250
 it demanded a rigorous informed consent procedures.

25
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,540
 So, the participants know what they're getting into and

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,740
 can back out at any time.

27
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,355
 These efforts all attempt to make sure that the positive results of research

28
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:27,355
 outweigh the negatives and that participant rights are always preserved.
