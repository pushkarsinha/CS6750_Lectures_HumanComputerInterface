00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,350
 In this lesson, we're largely focusing on the practical steps we

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,285
 go through to get approval for human subject's research.

3
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:09,480
 But before we get into that, I want to highlight that this isn't just a bunch

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,130
 of bureaucratic steps necessary to make sure the people are treated

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,010
 ethically at all stages of research, IRBs main task is to make sure

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,610
 the potential benefits of the study are worth the potential risks.

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,840
 So as part of that,

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,470
 part of the role is to make sure the potential benefits are significant.

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,060
 A lot of the steps of the process are going to ensure that the data that we

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,430
 gather is useful.

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,780
 So for example, the IRB is sensitive about the perception of coercion.

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,840
 When participants feel coerced to participate in research,

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,270
 the data they actually supply may be skewed by that negative perception

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,440
 which impacts our results.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,480
 Similarly, we might design studies that have some inherent biases or

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,560
 issues to them.

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,220
 We might demand too much from participants or

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,970
 ask questions that are known to affect our results.

19
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,470
 Much of the initial training to be certified to perform research is

20
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,500
 similarly not just about doing ethical research but

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,850
 also about doing good research.

22
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,400
 By recording who is certified, IRB helps ensure that research personnel

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,569
 all understand the basics of human subjects research.

24
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,990
 IRB is also there to monitor for these things as well and many of the steps of

25
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,900
 this process ensure that the research we perform is sound and useful.

26
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,820
 After all, if the research we perform is not useful,

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:14,820
 then even the smallest risks will outweigh the nonexistent benefits.
