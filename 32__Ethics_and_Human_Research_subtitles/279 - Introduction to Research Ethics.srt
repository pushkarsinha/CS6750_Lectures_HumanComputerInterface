00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,395
 Before we start working with real users there are a few ethical considerations

3
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:10,730
 we have to make.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,680
 If you are doing a research as part of a university these are part of your

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,000
 contract with the university to do research on their behalf.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,770
 Even if you are doing research independently for

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,470
 an industry there are still ethical obligations to follow.

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,060
 These considerations are important not only to preserve the rights of our

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,890
 users, but also to ensure the value of the data that we gather.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,670
 In this lesson, we'll talk a little bit about where these kinds of ethical

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,550
 considerations came from.

12
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,390
 Then we'll talk about some of

13
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,100
 the basic ethical considerations that we need to make.

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,460
 We'll also talk about Institutional Review Board, or IRB,

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:39,460
 the university organization that governs human subjects research.
