00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,920
 The fact that I'm filming this in the kitchen probably tells you where I

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,500
 experience this.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,610
 Anything related to cooking, I feel completely helpless.

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,750
 I've given myself food poisoning with undercooked meat lots of times,

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,510
 I once forgot to put the cheese on a grilled cheese sandwich.

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,810
 I accidentally made toast, and it wasn't even good toast.

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,550
 And I've always heard, it's just so easy, just follow the recipe, but

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,770
 no, it's not that easy, because many recipes are written for experts.

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,096
 So for example, here's a recipe from my wife's cookbook.

10
00:00:26,096 --> 00:00:28,830
 It calls for a medium saucepan.

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,200
 Is this a medium saucepan?

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,450
 I have no idea.

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,300
 Calls for one egg beaten with a splash of water.

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,890
 A splash, like a splash when you over fill a water bottle or

15
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,560
 a splash when your sibling soaks you at the pool?

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,918
 Pulse to combine.

17
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:49,590
 Cook until the edges are golden brown.

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,180
 What's golden brown?

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,570
 Give me a color code and I'll compare it, but otherwise,

20
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,000
 I don't know where on the spectrum from golden to brown, golden brown lies.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,900
 These are examples of places where the directions are given in a way that

22
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:00,900
 assumes I already have some expertise, that I really don't have.
