00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,705
 In this lesson, we talked about mental models.

2
00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:11,535
 We discussed what mental models are and how the user uses them to make sense of a system.

3
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:16,110
 We discussed how good representations can help users achieve strong models.

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,750
 We didn't discuss how issues with interfaces can lead to

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,500
 two different kinds of user error slips and mistakes.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,330
 We then discuss learned helplessness,

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,360
 which can come from giving poor feedback on user errors,

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,940
 and finally, we discussed expert blind spot and

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:29,940
 the importance of understanding that you are not your own user.
