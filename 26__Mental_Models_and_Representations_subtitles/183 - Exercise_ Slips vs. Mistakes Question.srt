 When you're looking to improve an interface,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,830
 user errors are powerful places to start.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,830
 They're indicative either of weaknesses in the user's mental model or

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,600
 places where the system isn't capturing the user's correct mental model.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,590
 So let's try to address an error Morgan's encountering.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,300
 Morgan usually texts with her boyfriend but

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,120
 she texts with some other people too.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,600
 But she finds she's often sending the wrong messages to the wrong people.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,560
 The app by default brings up the last open conversation and

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,110
 usually that's her boyfriend.

11
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,620
 But sometimes it's someone else and she accidentally messages them instead.

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:29,620
 First, is this a slip or is this a mistake?
