1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,110
 There are a number of things we can do here.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,480
 The simplest change we could make would simply be to make the breakers

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,890
 themselves writable.

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,210
 Instead of writing a list on the left that we have to then map up to

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,440
 the breakers themselves on the right,

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,970
 we could just write on each breaker what it controls.

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,595
 That way we just have to look at the breakers themselves to find the breaker

8
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:16,055
 that we're interested in.

9
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:19,095
 But then they still have to manually scan through all of them.

10
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:21,925
 We could further augment this by having a floor plan over here that actually

11
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:24,335
 gives the numbers on the floor plan for the breaker we want.

12
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:27,207
 So all I have to do is jump straight to the room that I'm interested in,

13
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:29,447
 find the number, go over the the list of breakers, and

14
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:32,299
 the label written on it would then confirm that I chose the right one.

15
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,288
 Now, if we wanted to get really crazy we could actually lay out the breakers

16
00:00:35,288 --> 00:00:37,100
 themselves to correspond to the floor plan.

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,890
 We can have a floor plan and

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,010
 actually put the breakers on the floors that they control.

19
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,035
 Or we could even just put the breakers in the rooms themselves.

20
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:44,745
 So if the power goes out to a certain room,

21
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:47,015
 I just go find the breaker in that room.

22
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:49,215
 But there we're starting to run into some of the other constraints on

23
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:49,735
 the problems.

24
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:52,585
 So it's probably best to stick to what we can control, without requiring

25
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:52,585
 that the physical device be manufactured differently in the first place.
