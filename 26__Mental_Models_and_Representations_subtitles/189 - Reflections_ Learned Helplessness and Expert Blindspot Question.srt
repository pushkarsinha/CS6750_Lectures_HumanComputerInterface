00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,630
 In order for us to really sympathize with users suffering from the effects of

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,500
 learned helplessness and expert blind spot, it's important for

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,350
 us to understand what it's like to be in that position.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,260
 We've all experienced these things at some point in life,

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,685
 although at the time, we might not have understood what was happening.

6
00:00:14,685 --> 00:00:15,855
 So take a second and

7
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:18,825
 reflect on a time when you experienced learned helplessness and

8
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:23,015
 the effects of expert blind spot from someone trying to teach you something.

9
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:26,395
 It might have been in a class, it might be learning a new skill, or it might be

10
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:29,445
 doing something that everyone else seems to do just fine day to day, but for

11
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:29,445
 whatever reason, you've always struggled with.
