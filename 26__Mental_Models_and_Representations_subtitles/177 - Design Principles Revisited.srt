00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,640
 In our lesson on design principles, we touch on a number of principles that

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,920
 are relevant to these ideas of mental models, representations, and metaphors.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,120
 First, the idea that people reason by analogy to pass interfaces,

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,910
 or by metaphors to the real world,

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,682
 is one of the reasons that the principle of consistency is so important.

6
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:18,370
 We want to be consistent with the analogies and

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,980
 metaphors that people use to make sense of our interfaces.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,370
 Second, when we say that an interface should teach the user how the system

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,590
 works, we're echoing the idea of affordances.

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,280
 The way the system looks, should tell the user how it's used.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,799
 Just by observing the system the,

12
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:37,235
 user should be learning how to interact with it.

13
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:40,615
 Third, representations are important because they map the interphase,

14
00:00:40,615 --> 00:00:42,445
 to the task at hand.

15
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:45,535
 A good representation is one that users can use predict the outcomes

16
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:46,815
 of certain actions.

17
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:50,505
 In other words, a good representation let's users predict the mapping

18
00:00:50,505 --> 00:00:50,505
 between their actions in the interphase, and the outcomes out in the world.
