00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,040
 In designing interfaces, we want to leverage analogies to the real world,

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,060
 and principles from past interfaces whenever possible,

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,470
 to help the user learn the new interface as quickly as they can.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,110
 But there's a challenge here.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,960
 Why are we designing technology if we're not providing users anything new?

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,220
 It's one thing to take the technology they're already using, and

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,700
 make it more usable.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,410
 But generally, we also want to enable people to do things they've never

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,710
 done before.

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,330
 That means there are no analogies, no expectations, no prior experiences for

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,900
 them leverage.

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,009
 How do you tell someone that's used to control their own thermostat that

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,720
 they don't need to anymore.

14
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,230
 So, while we need to leverage analogy and prior experience wherever possible.

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,250
 We also need to be aware that eventually,

16
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,190
 we're going to do something interesting, and they're going to break down.

17
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,815
 Eventually, we're going to have to teach the user to use the unique elements of

18
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:45,815
 our interface.
