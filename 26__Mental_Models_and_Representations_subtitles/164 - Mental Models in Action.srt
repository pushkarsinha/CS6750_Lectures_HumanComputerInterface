1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,019
 So let's talk a little bit about mental models in the context of the climate

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,140
 control systems we see on automobiles.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,270
 So this is my old car, it's a 1989 Volvo.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,530
 It, sadly, does not run anymore.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,540
 But let's talk about how the climate control system would work back when

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,180
 it did run.

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,020
 So, it's a hot day outside.

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,920
 Looking at these controls, how would you make the air temperature colder and

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,080
 the air come out faster?

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,180
 The natural thought to me would be to turn the fan speed up over on the right,

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,690
 and the air temperature to the blue side over on the left.

12
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,080
 But this doesn't actually make the temperature any colder,

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,340
 it just disables the heat.

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,310
 This dial over here in the top right,

15
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,720
 has to be turned on to make the air conditioning actually work.

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,380
 So just turning this thing over to the blue side doesn't actually turn on

17
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,810
 the air conditioning.

18
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:49,599
 So to make it colder, you have to both slide this lever over to the left, and

19
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:51,590
 turn this dial to the red area.

20
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,218
 It's kind of hard to see in this, but

21
00:00:53,218 --> 00:00:57,410
 this little area over here on the left side of this dial is actually red.

22
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:03,200
 The red area on the air conditioning control designates the maximum coldness.

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,180
 What?

24
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,220
 This also means you can turn on both the heat and the air conditioning at

25
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,110
 the same time and have neither of them blowing out if your fan is turned off.

26
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,030
 None of these really match my mental model of how this system works and

27
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,110
 the colors used here do nothing to correct my mental model.

28
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:18,970
 There's a control here

29
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,890
 that if you turn it to blue doesn't make the car any colder.

30
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,535
 And if you turn this other control to red, it does make the car colder.

31
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:27,015
 What?

32
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:28,955
 So back in 1989, there was a lot of room for

33
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:32,215
 improvement on designing the climate control system for a car like this.

34
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:34,635
 Let's see if we actually did improve that by talking about my new car,

35
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:37,375
 which is a 2015 Nissan Leaf.

36
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:41,405
 So in the 26 years since my old Volvo came out, have we gotten better at this?

37
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:42,776
 Well yeah, we've gotten a good bit better,

38
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:44,630
 although there's still a good bit of room for improvement.

39
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,830
 So, here's the climate control system from my Leaf.

40
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,793
 I have one dial, that turns the fan speed up and down.

41
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:53,240
 One dial that turns the temperature of the air coming out up and down.

42
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,850
 And so as far as that's concerned, it's pretty simple.

43
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,280
 But this interface still has some things that are pretty confusing.

44
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,104
 So for example, it has an automatic mode,

45
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:04,041
 where it tries to adjust the air temperature and the fan speed to bring

46
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,543
 the temperature of the car to the temperature that I want.

47
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,190
 So I press auto.

48
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,150
 Now it's going to change the fan speed, and change the air temperature, if

49
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,830
 I didn't already have it at the lowest, to try and get the car cooler faster.

50
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,410
 The problem is that I want to turn auto off, I don't actually know how to do it.

51
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,590
 Pressing auto doesn't actually turn it off.

52
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,260
 If I turn it so

53
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,630
 that it doesn't only circulate air inside the car, then it turns auto off.

54
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,980
 But that might not be what I wanted.

55
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,660
 Maybe I wanted it to go to a certain air temperature without

56
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,390
 just circulating the air in the car.

57
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,010
 I turn auto back on, it's going to turn that back on.

58
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,560
 Don't know why.

59
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,770
 So right now, as far as I know,

60
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,700
 the only way to turn auto off is to turn the circulation mode off.

61
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,864
 It also lets me turn AC and heat on at the same time,

62
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,374
 which I don't understand at all.

63
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,740
 Why would I ever need that?

64
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,450
 So there are some things that the system really should do better, or

65
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,630
 some things that it should constrain so the user doesn't do things

66
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,630
 that don't make sense in the context of wanting to set the temperature.
