00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,760
 Generally, when we're developing interfaces,

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,200
 we're going to be experts in those domains.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,020
 It's rare that you design an interface to help people do something that you

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,990
 yourself don't know how to do.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,820
 But as a result, there's risk for something called expert blind spot.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,580
 When you're an expert in something, there are parts of the task that you do

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,280
 subconsciously without even really thinking about them.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,440
 For example, a professional basketball player knows exactly where to place

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,650
 their hands on the ball when taking a shot.

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,860
 I know exactly what to do when I walk in the studio.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,900
 Amanda knows exactly what to do when she gets behind the camera.

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,130
 And yet, if we were suddenly asked to train someone else,

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,790
 there are lots of things we'd forget to say or

14
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,670
 lots of things we would assume would just be obvious.

15
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,450
 That's exactly what you're doing when you're designing an interface.

16
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,670
 You're teaching the user how to use what you've designed.

17
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,480
 You're teaching them without the benefit of actually talking to them,

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,370
 explaining things to them, or demonstrating things for them.

19
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,444
 You're teaching them through the design of the interface.

20
00:00:51,444 --> 00:00:56,000
 So, you have to make sure that you don't assume that they're an expert too.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,640
 You have to overcome that expert blind spot because we are not our users.

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,590
 We are not the user.

23
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,815
 That can be the motto of all of HCI.

24
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,680
 I am not my user.

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,768
 Say it with me, I am not my user.

26
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:13,020
 One more time, I am not my user.

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,020
 Now type it.
