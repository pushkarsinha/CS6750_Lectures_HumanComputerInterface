00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,560
 A good representation for our problem will make the solution self-evident.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,830
 Let's take a classic example of this.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,280
 A hiker starts climbing a mountain at 7 AM.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,645
 He arrives at the cabin on top at 7 PM.

5
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:16,701
 The next day, he leaves the cabin at 7 AM and arrives at the bottom at 7 PM.

6
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:17,797
 The question,

7
00:00:17,797 --> 00:00:17,797
 was the hiker ever at the same point at the same time on both days?
