00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
 The feedback cycle in HCI is reliant on a relationship

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,315
 between the users input and the interface's output.

3
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:08,610
 The idea of this cycle is that the user learns from

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,025
 the output what they should have input.

5
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:13,080
 If they do something that causes an error,

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,765
 they receive feedback on how to avoid that next time.

7
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,145
 If they do something correctly,

8
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:19,455
 then they see that their goal was accomplished.

9
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:21,270
 That's the principle of feedback.

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,740
 But what happens when there's

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,240
 no discernible interaction between the input and the output?

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,800
 What happens when there's a break in this cycle?

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,510
 What happens when the user acts in the system over and over and over again,

14
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,270
 but never receives any output that actually helps?

15
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,370
 What if they never even receive output that indicates that

16
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,315
 the computer is understanding them or receiving input from them?

17
00:00:40,315 --> 00:00:43,270
 That's when something called learned helplessness sets in.

18
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,365
 The human working with the interface

19
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:48,725
 learns that they're helpless to actually use the system.

20
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:53,480
 They learn that there is no mapping between their input and the output they receive.

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,610
 As a result, they believe that there's

22
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,700
 just nothing they can do to accomplish their goals.

23
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,260
 No one wants to feel that way.

24
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,420
 No one wants to feel like no matter what they do,

25
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,725
 they are doomed to failure.

26
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:05,570
 No one wants to feel like they're failing at

27
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,050
 something that everyone else seems to do very easily.

28
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,950
 So, it's very natural for people to develop

29
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:09,950
 this resistance to even try and to learn about this interface.
