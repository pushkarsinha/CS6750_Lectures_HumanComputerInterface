00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,274
 The most powerful tool in our arsenal to help ensure users have effective mental

2
00:00:04,274 --> 00:00:07,030
 models of our systems is representation.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,630
 We get to choose how things are visualized to users, and so

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,390
 we get to choose some of how their mental model develops.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,009
 Using good representations can make all the difference between effective and

6
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:18,392
 ineffective mental models.

7
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:22,590
 So to take an example, let's look at some instructions for assembling things.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,603
 So here are the instructions for a cat tree that I recently put together.

9
00:00:25,603 --> 00:00:28,180
 At first, I actually thought this was a pretty good representation.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,720
 You can kind of see how things fit together from the bottom to the top.

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,500
 The problem is that this representation doesn't actually map the physical

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,750
 construction of the cat tree itself.

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,320
 You can even see some bizarre mismatches even within this representation.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,146
 Up here, it looks like this pillar is in the front, but

15
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:45,227
 the screw hole that goes into it is actually shown in the back.

16
00:00:45,227 --> 00:00:47,553
 But we're not looking up into the bottom of that piece,

17
00:00:47,553 --> 00:00:50,241
 because in the middle piece, they actually map up pretty well.

18
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:51,541
 At least with the way they're shown here.

19
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,000
 Again, that isn't the way the actual piece works.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,960
 So anyway, the point is, this is a poor representation for

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,710
 the way this furniture actually worked,

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,950
 because it wasn't a real mapping between this representation and the real pieces.

23
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,730
 Lately I also put together some office furniture, and

24
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,140
 that actually had a very good representation.

25
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,480
 These are two of the steps from a hutch I put together to go over my desk.

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,610
 For the piece on the left, there was a perfect mapping between the way this

27
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,620
 piece worked and the way the screw holes were actually aligned on the piece.

28
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,328
 One clever thing they did is they actually showed this little

29
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:23,730
 screw hole right here that isn't used for this step.

30
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,760
 That helped me understand the mapping between this piece and my piece.

31
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,268
 And understand that when I saw that screw hole that didn't have a screw for

32
00:01:30,268 --> 00:01:30,967
 it, that was okay.

33
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:33,505
 It would be natural to think we only need to show

34
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:35,280
 what users actually need to do.

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,200
 But including that screw hole helps users understand the mapping

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,430
 between this representation and the actual piece.

37
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,280
 This more complicated step over on the right actually ended up being pretty

38
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,460
 intuitive as well.

39
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,270
 Although it's small and

40
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,860
 the details hard to see, the arrows they put along here made it pretty easy to

41
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,320
 see the direction you had to move things in order to put these pieces together.

42
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,680
 That's especially useful in places like up here,

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,600
 where the screw hole actually isn't visible in this diagram.

44
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,110
 But I can see that there is a screw hole here because of the way they represented

45
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,622
 this screw going into that hole.

46
00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:06,618
 I can look at the arrangement of these pieces and get a good feel for

47
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:08,919
 how the pieces are meant to fit together.

48
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,840
 So this representation helps me understand the problem in a way

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:11,840
 that the other representation did not.
