1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,520
 If you solved it,

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,950
 well done on figuring it out despite such a terrible representation.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,710
 Or congratulations on recognizing by analogy,

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,600
 that it's the same as a problem you've seen in another class.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,660
 If you skipped it, I don't blame you.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,210
 It's not an easy problem.

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,370
 But it's even harder when the representation is so poor.

8
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,830
 There were lots of weaknesses in that representation.

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,240
 Let's step through how we would improve it.

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,230
 The first thing we could do is simply write the problem out.

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,360
 Audio is a poor representation of complex problems.

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,570
 So here's a written representation of the problem.

13
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,530
 If the trouble you were having solving the exercise was just remembering

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,980
 all the rules, having this written down would be a huge help.

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,520
 But we can still do a lot better than this.

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,710
 Instead, we can represent the problem visually.

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,670
 Here we have the shapes, the three circles and the three squares.

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,675
 And we can imagine actually moving them back and forth.

19
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:56,390
 That arrow in the center, represents the direction of the next move.

20
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,060
 But we can still do better.

21
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,680
 Right now we have to work to compare the number of squares and circles, so

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,940
 let's line them up.

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,510
 This makes it very easy to compare and

24
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,350
 make sure that the circles always outnumber the squares.

25
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,238
 And we can still do the same manipulation,

26
00:01:09,238 --> 00:01:11,660
 moving them back and forth.

27
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,503
 Now the only remaining problem is that we have to keep in working memory,

28
00:01:15,503 --> 00:01:18,730
 the rule that squares may not outnumber circles.

29
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,430
 There is no natural reason why need more squares than circles,

30
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,570
 it's just kind of an arbitrary rule.

31
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,540
 So let's make it more self evident.

32
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,820
 Let's make the squares wolves, and the circles sheep.

33
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,570
 As long as the sheep outnumber the wolves,

34
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,750
 the sheep can defend themselves, kind of.

35
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,740
 But if the wolves ever outnumber the sheep, they'll eat them.

36
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,470
 But if there are no sheep, then there's nothing for the wolves to eat, so

37
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,700
 that's okay.

38
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,510
 So now we have a new representation of the problem,

39
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,190
 one that will make the problem much easier to solve.

40
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,970
 The rules are more obvious, and it's easier to evaluate whether or

41
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,410
 not they're being met.

42
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,840
 Finally, we can make this visualization even a little bit more useful,

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,820
 by actually showing the movements between different states.

44
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,313
 That way we can see that for any state in the problem,

45
00:01:57,313 --> 00:01:59,588
 there's a finite number of next legal states.

46
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:02,782
 This would also allow us to notice when we've accidentally revisited

47
00:02:02,782 --> 00:02:05,930
 an earlier state, so we can avoid going around in circles.

48
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,970
 So for example, from this state, we might choose to move the wolf and

49
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,680
 the sheep back to the left, but

50
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,280
 we'll immediately notice that would make the state the same as this one.

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,700
 And it's not useful to backtrack and revisit an earlier state.

52
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,510
 So we know not to do that.

53
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,640
 So these representations have made it much easier to solve this problem,

54
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:22,640
 than just the verbal representation we started with.
