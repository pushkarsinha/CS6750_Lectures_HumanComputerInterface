00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,710
 Mental models are not a uniquely HCI principle.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,340
 In fact, if you search for mental models online, you'll probably find just as

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,590
 much about them in the context of education, as the context of HCI.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,420
 And that's actually a very useful analogy to keep in mind.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,940
 When you're designing an interfce you're playing, very much,

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,810
 the role of an educator.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,850
 Your goal is to teach your user how the system works

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,150
 through the design of your interface.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,930
 But unlike a teacher, you don't generally have the benefit of

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,440
 being able to stand here and explain things directly to your user.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,081
 Most users don't watch tutorials or read documentation or if they do,

12
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:34,770
 they don't want to.

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,815
 You have to design interfaces that teach users while they're using them.

14
00:00:38,815 --> 00:00:40,865
 That's where representations come in.

15
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:45,225
 Good representations show the user exactly how the system actually works.

16
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:46,925
 It's an enormous challenge, but

17
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:46,925
 it's also incredibly satisfying when you do it well.
