00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,180
 Representations are all around us in the real world, but

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,790
 they play a huge role in interfaces.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,360
 Designing representations of the current state of a system is actually one of

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,530
 the most common tasks you might perform as an interface designer.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,160
 So let's take a look at a few,

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,250
 here's Google Calendar which is a representation of my week.

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,400
 Notice how it actually uses space to represent blocks of time.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,670
 It allows me to quickly feel how long different things are going to take.

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,240
 An alternate visualization might show an entire month instead of a week, but

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,756
 it would lose those indicators that linked the individual appointments.

11
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:33,420
 So it doesn't really represent the structure and

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,580
 pace of my day, the way the weekly calendar does.

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,690
 This representation also allows me to very easily find conflicts in my

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,530
 schedule.

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,340
 So I know when I might need to reschedule something.

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,900
 On Friday I can see that I have a conflict for one of my meetings.

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,670
 And this interface also makes it easy to reschedule.

18
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,170
 I can pull up the calendar for the other person I'm meeting with and

19
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,040
 identify places where we both have free in our schedule.

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,904
 Another example of this is the PowerPoint animation pang.

21
00:00:56,904 --> 00:00:59,608
 The numbers here represent when different animations

22
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:01,210
 happen concurrently.

23
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,099
 The middle icon represents what triggers the animation, and

24
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,130
 the right icon indicates the general nature of the animation.

25
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,450
 Whether it's a movement, a highlight or an appearance.

26
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,430
 The PC version of PowerPoint makes this even better by actually showing you

27
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,030
 a timeline of the different animations to the right.

28
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,060
 That lets you very easily visualize when two different things are going to happen

29
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,150
 at the same time.

30
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,670
 Or when something waits for something else to happen.

31
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,030
 These are just two of the many many representations you use whenever you

32
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,290
 use a computer.

33
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,120
 Scroll bars for

34
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,280
 example, are representations of your relative position in a document.

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,520
 Highlighting markers like that rectangle are representations of what you

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,970
 currently have selected.

37
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,490
 All these representations work together to help your mental model match

38
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,380
 the real state of the system.

39
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,243
 Representations when used correctly can make many tasks trivial, or

40
00:01:46,243 --> 00:01:47,700
 even invisible.

41
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,340
 And we as interface designers have a lot of control

42
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:50,340
 over representations in our designs.
