1
00:00:00,235 --> 00:00:03,070
 Norman also divides mistakes in the multiple categories, in this case,

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,500
 three categories.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,650
 Rule based mistakes, knowledge base mistakes and memory lapse mistakes.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,600
 Rule based mistakes occur where the user correctly assesses the state

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,090
 of the world but makes the wrong decision based on it.

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,900
 Knowledge based mistakes occur where the user incorrectly assesses the state of

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,610
 the world in the first place.

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,580
 Memory lapse mistakes are similar to memory lapse slips, but

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,880
 this focuses on forgetting to fully execute a plan

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,190
 not just forgetting to do something in the first place.

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,540
 If the user clicks the wrong button in this dialog,

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,220
 it could be do to multiple different kinds of mistakes.

13
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,120
 Maybe they correctly knew they wanted to save their changes but

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,300
 they didn't realize that clicking no is actually what would save,

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,430
 that would be a rule-based mistake.

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,500
 They knew they wanted to save,

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,660
 but they made the wrong decision based on that knowledge.

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,270
 Or perhaps they didn't even realize they wanted to save in the first place.

19
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,490
 Maybe they didn't think they made any changes, when in actuality they did.

20
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,570
 That would be a knowledge based mistake.

21
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,050
 They applied the right rule based on their knowledge but

22
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,640
 their knowledge was inaccurate.

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,540
 If they were to shut down their computer and never come back and answer this

24
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,250
 dialogue in the first place, that might be considered a memory lapse mistake.

25
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,740
 They didn't fully execute the plan of closing down the application.

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,610
 So in our designs, we want to do everything we can

27
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,020
 to prevent all these different kinds of errors.

28
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,060
 We want to help prevent routine errors by leveraging consistent practices

29
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,730
 like designing dialogues the way users are used to.

30
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,190
 We also want to let our interface off load some of the demands on working

31
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,650
 memory from the user to the computer to avoid memory lapse errors.

32
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,675
 And we want the leverage good representations to help users develop

33
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:36,383
 the right mental of models to minimize these rule-based and

34
00:01:36,383 --> 00:01:37,980
 knowledge-based errors.

35
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,720
 And while errors are inevitable, we should make sure to leverage

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:40,720
 the tolerance principle to make sure the repercussions can never be too bad.
