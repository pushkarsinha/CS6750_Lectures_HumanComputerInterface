 Don Norman further divides slips into two different categories.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,545
 He describes action-based slips and memory lapse slips.

3
00:00:07,545 --> 00:00:10,920
 Action-based slips are places where the user performs the wrong action, or

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,750
 performs a right action on the wrong object,

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,110
 even though they knew the correct action.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,490
 They might click the wrong button, or right-click when they should left-click.

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,500
 A memory lapse slip occurs when the user forgets something they knew to do.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,580
 For example, they might forget to start a timer on a microwave.

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,992
 They knew what to do, they just forgot about it.

10
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:30,680
 So action-based slips are doing the wrong thing, and

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,560
 memory lapse slips are forgetting to do the right thing.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,960
 In this dialog, clicking No when you mean to click Yes

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,300
 would be an example of an action-based slip.

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,180
 The very existence of this dialog is meant to prevent a memory lapse slip,

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:43,180
 where a user would forget to save their work before closing.
