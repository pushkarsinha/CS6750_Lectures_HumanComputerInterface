 Just like mental models, learned helplessness is also a topic related as

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,530
 much to education as it is to HCI.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,210
 If you've ever spent any time in a teaching role,

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,740
 you very likely encountered students that are very resistant to being taught.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,660
 And the reason is they have learned that no matter what they do,

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,100
 they never succeed.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,030
 They've learned to be helpless based on their past experiences.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,570
 In all likelihood, there have actually been situations where

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,610
 you've been the one learning that you're helpless.

10
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,920
 In fact, if you're a parent,

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,720
 I can almost guarantee you've been in that situation.

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,440
 There are times when your child was crying and inconsolable and

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,910
 you had no clue why.

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,210
 We had one of those right before we filmed this video.

15
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,540
 Nothing you did helped.

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,320
 And you learned that you were helpless to figure out what your child wanted.

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,430
 So if you're a parent and

18
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,190
 you're dealing with learned helplessness as an interface designer,

19
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,030
 just imagine that you are the user and the interface is your screaming child.

20
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,790
 What feedback would

21
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,290
 you need from your child to figure out how you can help them?

22
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,604
 And how can you build that kind of feedback into your interface?
