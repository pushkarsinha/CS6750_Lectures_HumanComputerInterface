00:00:06,104 --> 00:00:09,920
 Today we're going to talk about mental models and representations.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,730
 A mental model is the understanding you hold in your head about

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,390
 the world around you.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,150
 Simulating a mental model allows you to make predictions and

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,630
 figure out how to achieve your goals out in the real world.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,460
 A good interface will give the user a good mental model of the system

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,170
 that it presents.

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,320
 In order to develop good medal models we need to give users good representations

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,260
 of the system with which they're interacting.

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:31,900
 In that way,

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,140
 we can help users learn how to use our interfaces as quickly as possible.

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,240
 So that's what we'll talk about in this lesson, creating representations that

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,280
 help users develop accurate mental models of our systems.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,420
 We'll start by talking about mental models in general and

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,670
 how they apply to the interfaces with which we're familiar.

17
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,240
 Then we'll talk about how representations can make problem

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,690
 solving easier or harder.

19
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,240
 After that, we'll talk about how metaphors and analogies can be useful

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,760
 tools to create good representations that lead to accurate mental models.

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,349
 Then we'll discuss how user error can arise either from inaccuracies or

22
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,620
 mistakes in the user's mental model, or just from accidental slips,

23
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,220
 despite an accurate mental model.

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,900
 Finally, we'll close by discussing learned helplessness, one

25
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,410
 of the repercussions of poor interface design, as well as expert blindspot,

26
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:17,410
 which is one of the reasons why poor design can occur.
