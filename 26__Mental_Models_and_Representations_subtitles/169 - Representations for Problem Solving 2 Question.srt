 For simple problems, identifying a good representation can be easy.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,810
 But what about for more complex problems?

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,590
 For those problems,

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,600
 we might need some examples of what makes a good representation.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,710
 So let's try a complex example.

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,629
 We'll use a problem with which you might be familiar.

7
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:18,600
 For now, I'll call it the circles and squares problem.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,922
 On one side of a table, I have three circles and three squares.

9
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:23,946
 My goal is to move the three circles and

10
00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:26,360
 three squares to the other side of the table.

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,463
 I can only move two shapes at at time, and the direction of the moves must

12
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:32,590
 alternate, starting with a move to the right.

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,940
 The number of squares on either side can never outnumber the number of circles

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,330
 unless there are no circles at all on that side.

15
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,710
 How many moves does it take to accomplish this?

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,820
 Try it out and enter the number of moves it takes in the box.

17
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:45,820
 Or just skip if you give up.
