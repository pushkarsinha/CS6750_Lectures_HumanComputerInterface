00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,230
 So let's take an example of redesigning a representation to create

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,340
 a better mapping with a task.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,850
 Here we have my circuit breaker.

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,930
 On the left we have a list of breakers,

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,170
 on the right we have what they actually control.

6
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,080
 To reset a breaker I need to go down the list on the left, find the one I want,

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,620
 count down on the right to find the right breaker, and switch it.

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:18,620
 How can we make this representation of what each breaker corresponds to better?
