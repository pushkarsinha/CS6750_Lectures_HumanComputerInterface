1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,100
 I would argue this is a slip.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,910
 Morgan knows who she means to message but

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,130
 the phone's behavior tricks her into sending things to the wrong people.

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,270
 What's more, this might be either an action based slip or memory lapse slip.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,780
 Maybe Morgan is tapping the wrong person,

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,320
 or maybe she's forgetting to check who she's messaging.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,130
 So take a second and brainstorm a design for this that can prevent this from

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,970
 happening in the future without over complicating the interaction too much.

9
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,520
 I would argue that the best way to do this is simply to show

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,600
 more pervasive reminders of who Morgan is currently texting.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,590
 We could show the recipient's picture on the send button, for example.

12
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,912
 That way, the interaction is no more complex, but

13
00:00:32,912 --> 00:00:32,912
 Morgan also has to directly acknowledge who she's messaging to send a message.
