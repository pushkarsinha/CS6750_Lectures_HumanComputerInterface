00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
 As we design interfaces,

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,919
 we will no doubt encounter instances where the user makes mistakes.

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,700
 Sometimes this might be because our users are stressed or distracted,

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,400
 but other times it might be because our users fundamentally don't

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,015
 understand our interfaces or even don't understand their own goals.

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,975
 As designers though, we know there's really no such thing as user error.

7
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:21,180
 Any user error is a failure of

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,630
 the interface to properly guide the user to the right action.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,460
 In designing interfaces, there are

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,995
 two kinds of user error that we're interested in avoiding.

11
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,885
 The first are called slips.

12
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:34,140
 Slips occur when the user has the right mental model,

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,140
 but does the wrong thing anyway.

14
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,460
 Take this box for example,

15
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,960
 prompting a user closing a program on whether they'd like to save their work.

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,775
 In all likelihood, the user knows exactly what they want to do,

17
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:46,550
 and typically, it's going to be to actually save their work.

18
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,935
 If you ask them to explain what they should do,

19
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:50,420
 they would say, "Click Yes."

20
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,105
 But imagine if the order of these buttons was flipped

21
00:00:53,105 --> 00:00:56,060
 so that the No was on the left and Yes was on the right.

22
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,825
 A user might click on the left just because they used to seeing Yes on the left,

23
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:02,930
 even though they know they really want to click Yes.

24
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,570
 Or imagine that No is selected by default.

25
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,660
 So that if a user just presses enter when this dialog comes up,

26
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,180
 it automatically says No.

27
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,490
 In that case also,

28
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,280
 they knew that they wanted to save their work,

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,565
 but what they did didn't match the goal they wanted to accomplish.

30
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:17,980
 A mistake on the other hand,

31
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,640
 happens when the user has the wrong mental model and does the wrong thing as a result.

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,235
 Take this prompt for example.

33
00:01:24,235 --> 00:01:27,260
 The users asked if they want to revert to the original file.

34
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,580
 That's really just a backwards way of asking whether they want to save,

35
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,245
 but this is foreign terminology to many users.

36
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:35,525
 Their mental model of what saving is

37
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:38,275
 doesn't tell him necessarily what to do in this instance.

38
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:40,595
 What's more, they don't actually have a choice here.

39
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:41,735
 Without a cancel button,

40
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:45,665
 they're forced to choose knowing one option could mean losing their changes.

41
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:47,720
 Here the problem is a mismatch between

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,520
 their internal model and the way the system is working,

43
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,690
 or at least the way it describes itself.

44
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,620
 So, slip occurs when the user knows

45
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,080
 the right thing to do but does the wrong thing anyway,

46
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,080
 but a mistake occurs when the user doesn't even know the right thing to do.
