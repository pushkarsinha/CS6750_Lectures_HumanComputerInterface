1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,400
 Let's watch that animation again.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,217
 The hiker goes up the hill on one day, stays the night.

3
00:00:10,217 --> 00:00:14,440
 And then goes back down the hill the next day.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,520
 And we want to know,

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,420
 was the hiker ever at the same point at the same time on both days?

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,680
 And the answer is yes.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,460
 Describe the way we describe it right here,

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,180
 it might actually seem odd that there is a point where the hiker is

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,520
 in the same place at the same time on both days.

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,550
 That seems like a strange coincidence, but

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,990
 what if we tweak the representation a little bit?

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,990
 Instead of one hiker going up and then coming down the next day.

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,020
 Let's visualize the two days at the same time.

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,270
 If we represent the problem like this,

15
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,370
 we'll quickly see the hiker has to pass himself.

16
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,550
 To show it again, we know the answer is yes,

17
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,290
 because there's a time when the hiker would have passed himself if he was

18
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,740
 going in both directions on the same day.

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,440
 And to pass himself, he has to be in the same point at the same time.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:58,440
 That representation took a hard problem and made it very easy.
