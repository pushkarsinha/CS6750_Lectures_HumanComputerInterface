1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,220
 The quickest way to get more involved in HCI if you're at Georgia Tech,

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,435
 is to see about joining a professor's research team.

3
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:08,670
 On the Georgia Tech HCI faculty listing,

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,484
 you'll find listings for every HCI faculty member along with their research interests.

5
00:00:13,484 --> 00:00:16,750
 Find someone who's working on the same kinds of things that you want to work on,

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,135
 and see if they'd let you join one of their ongoing research projects.

7
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:22,430
 Professors are extremely busy people,

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,895
 but one of the things I love about Georgia Tech is the school's focus on

9
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:30,470
 fostering student education and involvement in addition to fostering quality research.

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,840
 So, it's quite likely that you'll find someone willing to

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,690
 let you join up and prove that you can contribute.

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:40,900
 Let's check our list of what kind of projects are going on.

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,940
 Near research projects are coming up all the time,

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,280
 and new faculty are joining every year,

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,775
 that's why I'm not listing names of specific projects.

16
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:51,335
 But if any of these domains are interesting to you,

17
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:53,210
 check out the HCI faculty websites,

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:53,210
 and see if there's anything to which you'd like to contribute.
