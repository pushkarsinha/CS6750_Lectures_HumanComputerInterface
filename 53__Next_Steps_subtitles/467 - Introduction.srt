 To close our journey through HCI,

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,545
 let's take a look at where you might go from here.

3
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:14,115
 We've already talked about different application areas of HCI like,

4
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:16,425
 virtual reality in educational technology,

5
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:19,095
 and those certainly apply to what you could do next.

6
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:22,290
 We've also talked elsewhere about the deeper topics in HCI you might

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,175
 investigate like intelligent user interfaces, or Human-Centered Computing.

8
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:28,170
 But to close, let's talk about

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:28,170
 the formal educational steps you might take going forward to get deeper into HCI.
