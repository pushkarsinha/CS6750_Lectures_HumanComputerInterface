00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,205
 No matter what you do next,

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:09,300
 I hope you've enjoyed this foray into the world of human-computer interaction.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,910
 If you in this course feeling like you actually know less than when you started,

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,370
 then that's perfectly fine.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,190
 My goal was not only to teach you about HCI,

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,685
 but also to help you understand how big this community is.

7
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:22,560
 I look forward to seeing you all go further in

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,840
 community and make a difference in the world.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,350
 To close, I have to give a special thank you to Georgia Tech for creating

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,205
 this fantastic online masters program in which I'm developing this course.

11
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:34,900
 I'd also like to thank the HCI faculty at Georgia Tech

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,800
 for letting me be the one to record this and bring it to you.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,410
 Most of all, I'd like to thank Amanda and Morgan,

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,500
 my partners in creating this course for

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,380
 being totally responsible for how amazing it's looked.

16
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,085
 I like to think this isn't just a course about human-computer interaction,

17
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:52,435
 but it's also an example of human-computer interactions,

18
00:00:52,435 --> 00:00:57,680
 humans using computers to teach about HCI in new and engaging ways.

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:57,680
 Thank you for watching.
