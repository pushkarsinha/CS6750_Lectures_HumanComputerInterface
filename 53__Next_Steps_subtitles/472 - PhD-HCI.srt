1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
 If research really is your calling though,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,320
 then you might want to move on to a PhD which can have a specialization in HCI as well.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,080
 Now, a PhD isn't for everyone.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,130
 There's a tendency to view it as the next logical step after a master's degree,

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,430
 but a PhD program is far more of an apprenticeship program.

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,910
 At Georgia Tech, at least, a PhD actually

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,625
 requires fewer classes to complete than a master's,

8
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,800
 but that's because 90 percent of your time is spent

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,320
 working closely with a faculty research adviser.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,930
 But if you're very interested in research,

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,165
 the PhD may very well be the way to go.

12
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,970
 So, as a reminder, here were some of the project areas that

13
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:40,850
 have ongoing research in HCI going on here at Georgia Tech.

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,100
 A PhD program is a huge commitment.

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,115
 It's your full-time job for typically five years.

16
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:49,105
 It's absolutely not for everyone,

17
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:51,595
 but it absolutely is for some people.

18
00:00:51,595 --> 00:00:54,320
 So, if you're really passionate about what you've learned here,

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,320
 a PhD focusing on HCI maybe the way to go.
