1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,010
 If you want to take this a step further though,

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,630
 you might get an actual Master's in Computer Science, specializing in HCI.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,530
 Now if you're a Georgia Tech student watching this,

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,340
 you might already be working towards a Master's in CS,

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,074
 and you might be wondering if the HCI specialization is available online.

6
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:17,400
 Now right now while I'm recording this it's not,

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,410
 but I'll pause for a second so Amanda can let us know if that's changed.

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,120
 If you're an on-campus student watching this,

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,720
 or if you're just watching the open MOOC,

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,050
 then you might want to look into an MS and CS with a focus on HCI.

11
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,470
 Most MS, CS programs I've seen have an HCI specialization,

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,805
 or at least an HCI focus.

13
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:38,630
 The specialization lets you go far deeper into the field

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,779
 taking several classes on topics like core HCI,

15
00:00:41,779 --> 00:00:43,880
 User Interface Design, Educational Technology,

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,680
 Mixed Reality Design, Information Visualization and more.

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,840
 We'll gather a list of schools with MS,

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:49,840
 CS programs with HCI specializations and provide it in the notes below.
