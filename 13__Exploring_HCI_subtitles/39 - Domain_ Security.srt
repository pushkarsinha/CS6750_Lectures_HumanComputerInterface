00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,890
 Classes on network security are often most concerned with the algorithms and

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,450
 encryption methods that must be safeguarded to ensure secure

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,800
 communications.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,730
 But the most secure communication strategies in the world are weakened if

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,770
 people just refuse to use them.

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,080
 And historically, we've found people have very little patience for

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,980
 instances where security measures get in the way of them doing their tasks.

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,640
 For security to be useful it has to be usable.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,730
 If it isn't usable, people just won't use it.

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,970
 XEI can increase the usability of security in a number of ways.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,160
 For one, it can make those actions simply easier to perform.

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,230
 CAPTCHAs are forms that are meant to ensure users are humans.

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,810
 And they used to involve recognizing letters in complex images, but

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,290
 now they're often as simple as a check-box.

15
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,960
 The computer recognizes human-like mouse movements and

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,890
 uses that to evaluate whether the user is a human.

17
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,822
 That makes it much less frustrating to participate in that security activity.

18
00:00:47,822 --> 00:00:51,043
 But HCI can also make security more usable by visualizing and

19
00:00:51,043 --> 00:00:53,170
 communicating the need.

20
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,710
 Many people get frustrated when systems require passwords that meet certain

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,050
 standards or complexity, but that's because it seems arbitrary.

22
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,740
 If the system instead expresses to the user the rationale behind

23
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,120
 the requirement, the requirement can be much less frustrating.

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,370
 I've even seen a password form that treats password selection like a game

25
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,640
 where you're ranked against others for

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,960
 how difficult your password would be to guess.

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,620
 That's a way to incentivize strong password selection

28
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:15,620
 making security more usable.
