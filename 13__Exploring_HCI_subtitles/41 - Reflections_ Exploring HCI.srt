1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,030
 Throughout our conversations, we're going to explore some of

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,670
 the fundamental principles and methods of HCI.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,030
 Depending on the curriculum surrounding this material,

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,740
 you'll complete assignments, projects,

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,360
 exams, and other assessments in some of these design areas.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,630
 However, we'd also like you to apply what you learned to an area of your choice.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,240
 So, pick an area.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,970
 Either one we've mentioned here or one you'd like to know about separately,

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,235
 and keep it in mind as we go through the course.

10
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,410
 Our hope is that by the end of the course,

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,790
 you'll be able to apply what you learn

12
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:29,790
 here to the area in which you're interested in working.
