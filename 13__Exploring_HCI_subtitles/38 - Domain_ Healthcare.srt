00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,210
 A lot of current efforts in healthcare are about processing the massive

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,850
 quantities of data that are recorded everyday.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,230
 But in order to make that data useful,

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,680
 it has to connect to real people at some point.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,370
 Maybe it's equipping doctors with tools to more easily visually evaluate and

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,400
 compare different diagnoses.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,220
 Maybe it's giving patients the tools necessary to monitor their own health

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,780
 and treatment options.

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,550
 Maybe that's information visualization so

10
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,850
 patients can understand how certain decisions affect their well-being.

11
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,720
 Maybe it's context aware computing that can detect when patients are about to do

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,000
 something they probably shouldn't do.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,550
 There are also numerous applications of HCI to personal health like Fitbit for

14
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,830
 exercise monitoring or MyFitnessPal for tracking your diet.

15
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,110
 Those interfaces succeed if they're easily usable for users.

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,220
 Ideally, they'd be almost invisible.

17
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,850
 But perhaps the most fascinating upcoming intersection of HCI and

18
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,240
 health care is in virtual reality.

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,080
 Virtual reality exercise programs are already pretty common to make living

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,960
 an active lifestyle more fun, but what about virtual reality for therapy?

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,730
 That's actually already happening.

22
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,130
 We can use virtual reality to help people confront fears and

23
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,470
 anxieties in a safe, but highly authentic place.

24
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,450
 Healthcare in general is concerned with the health of humans.

25
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,110
 And computers are pretty commonly used in modern healthcare.

26
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,660
 So the applications of human computer interaction to healthcare

27
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:09,660
 are really huge.
