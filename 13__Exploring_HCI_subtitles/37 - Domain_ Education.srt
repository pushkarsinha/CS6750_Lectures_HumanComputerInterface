 Hi, and welcome to Educational Technology.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,655
 My name is David Joyner, and I'm thrilled to bring you this course.

3
00:00:05,655 --> 00:00:10,275
 As you might guess, education is one of my favorite application areas of HCI.

4
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:11,490
 In fact, as I'm recording this,

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,550
 I've been teaching educational technology at Georgia Tech for about a year,

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,170
 and a huge portion of designing

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,785
 educational technology is really just straightforward HCI.

8
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:23,235
 But education puts some unique twists on the HCI process.

9
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:25,830
 Most fascinatingly, education is an area where you

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,650
 might not always want to make things as easy as possible.

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,470
 You might use HCI to introduce some desirable difficulties,

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,480
 some learning experiences for students.

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,630
 But it's important to ensure that the cognitive load students experienced

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,750
 during a learning task is based on the material itself,

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,115
 not based on trying to figure out our interfaces.

16
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:45,560
 The worst thing you can do in HCI for education is raise

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,570
 the student's cognitive load because they're too busy thinking

18
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,885
 about your interface instead of the subject matter itself.

19
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,510
 Lots of very noble efforts in designing technology for

20
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,290
 education have failed due to poor HCI.

21
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,670
 So, if you're interested in going in educational technology,

22
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:58,670
 you'll find a lot of valuable lessons in human-computer interaction.
