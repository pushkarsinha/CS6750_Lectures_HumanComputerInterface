00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,590
 Virtual reality generally works by replacing the real world's visual,

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,600
 auditory, and

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,590
 sometimes even all factory or kinesthetic stimuli with it's own input.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,750
 Augmented reality on the other hand, compliments what you see and

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,190
 hear in the real world.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,020
 So for example, imagine a headset like a Google Glass that

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,220
 automatically overlays directions right on your visual field.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,400
 If you were driving, it would highlight the route to take,

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,160
 instead of just popping up some visual reminder.

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,490
 The input it provides complements stimuli coming from the real world,

11
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,510
 and instead of just replacing them.

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,310
 And that creates some enormous challenges, but

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,190
 also some really incredible opportunities as well.

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,960
 Imagine the devices that can integrate directly into our everyday lives,

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,620
 enhancing our reality.

16
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,770
 Imagine systems that could, for example, automatically translate text or

17
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,590
 speech in a foreign language, or could show your reviews for

18
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,730
 restaurants as you walk down the street.

19
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,640
 Imagine a system that students could use while touring national parks or

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,090
 museums, that would automatically point out interesting information,

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,760
 custom tailored to that student's own interests.

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,810
 The applications of augmented reality could be truly stunning, but

23
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,030
 it relies on cameras to take input from the world, and

24
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,590
 that actually raises some interesting societal problems.

25
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,900
 There are questions about what putting cameras everywhere would mean.

26
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:07,900
 So keep those in mind when we get to interfaces and politics, in unit two.
