00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,520
 Video games are one of the purest examples of HCI.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,890
 They're actually a great place to study HCI, because so

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,760
 many of the topics we discuss are so salient.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,800
 For example, we discussed the need for logical mapping between actions and

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,870
 effects.

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,590
 A good game exemplifies that.

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,380
 The actions that the user takes with the controller should feel like they're

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,510
 actually interacting within the game world.

9
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,720
 We discussed the power of feedback cycles.

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,400
 Video games are near constant feedback cycles as the user performs actions,

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,960
 evaluates the results and adjust accordingly.

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,740
 In fact, if you read through video game reviews you'll find that

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,560
 many of the criticisms are actually criticisms of bad HCI.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,410
 The controls are tough to use, it's hard to figure out what happened.

15
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,280
 The penalty for failure is too low or too high.

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,170
 All of these are examples of poor interface design.

17
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,690
 In gaming though there's such a tight connection between the task and

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,710
 the interface.

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,750
 Their frustrations with a task can help us quickly identify

20
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,750
 problems with the interface.
