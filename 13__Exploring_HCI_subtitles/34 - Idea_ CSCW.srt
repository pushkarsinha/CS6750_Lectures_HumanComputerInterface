1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,825
 CSCW stands for computer-supported cooperative work.

2
00:00:03,825 --> 00:00:05,655
 The field is just what the name says.

3
00:00:05,655 --> 00:00:08,820
 How do we use computers to support people working together?

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,380
 You're watching this course online,

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,525
 so I'll tell the experienced as closely.

6
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:15,825
 Maybe you've worked on a group project with a geographically distributed group.

7
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:17,745
 Maybe you've had a job working remotely.

8
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:22,230
 Distributed teams are one example of CSCW in action, but there are others.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,400
 The community often breaks things down to two dimensions, time and place.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,130
 We can think of design as whether or not we're designing for the users in

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,930
 the same time and place or users at different times and in different places.

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,015
 This course is an example of designing for different time and different place.

13
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:38,960
 You're watching this long after I've recorded it,

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,895
 likely from far away from our studio.

15
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:43,280
 Workplace chat utilities, like Slack and HipChat,

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,575
 would be examples of same time, different place.

17
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:48,110
 They allow people to communicate instantly across space,

18
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,440
 mimicking the real-time office experience.

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,480
 Now, imagine a kiosk at a museum that asks visitors

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,615
 to enter their location to create a map of where everyone comes from.

21
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:59,225
 That would be different time, same place.

22
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,515
 Everyone uses the interface at the same place, but across time.

23
00:01:02,515 --> 00:01:04,800
 Even when we're in the same time and place,

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,825
 computers can still support cooperation.

25
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:09,180
 In fact, right now, a man is running our camera,

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,439
 Ben's running the teleprompter,

27
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,410
 and I'm standing up here talking at you.

28
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,090
 These different computers are supporting us and cooperating to create this course.

29
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,500
 So, we can often think of CSCW as mediating

30
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,755
 cooperation across traditional geographic or temporal borders,

31
00:01:21,755 --> 00:01:21,755
 but it can also help us with co-located simultaneous cooperation.
