00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,020
 In this lesson, our goal has been to give you an overview of

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,380
 the exciting expansive ongoing HCI research and development.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,005
 We encourage you to select a topic you find interesting,

4
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:14,355
 read about a little bit more,

5
00:00:14,355 --> 00:00:16,635
 and think about it as you go through the course.

6
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:19,140
 Then, in unit four, we'll provide some additional readings and

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,540
 materials on many of these topics for you to peruse.

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,150
 In fact, you can feel free to jump ahead to there now as well.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,015
 But before we get too far into what we want to design,

10
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:27,015
 we first must cover the fundamental principles and methods of HCI.
