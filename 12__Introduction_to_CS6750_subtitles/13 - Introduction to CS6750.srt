 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,138 --> 00:00:09,391
 Now that you understand a little bit about what human-computer interaction

3
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:12,540
 is, let's talk about what this class is going to be like.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,950
 In this lesson, I am going to take you through a high level overview

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:15,800
 of this class.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,300
 What material we'll cover, how it fits together, and

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,830
 what you should expect to know by the end of the course.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,390
 I'll also talk a little bit about the assessments we'll use in the class, but

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,770
 be aware, these assessments are only applicable to students taking this class

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,090
 through Georgia Tech.

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,020
 If you're watching this course on your own or taking it to complement other

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,070
 courses you're taking, those assessments won't apply to you, but

13
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,270
 you'll get to hear a little bit about what students in the actual course do.

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,850
 If you are a student in the course,

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,490
 you should know the assessments do tend to change a bit semester to semester.

16
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,870
 I'm going to try and stay as general as possible to capture future changes, but

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,690
 make sure to pay attention to the specific materials you're provided for

18
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:48,690
 your semester.
