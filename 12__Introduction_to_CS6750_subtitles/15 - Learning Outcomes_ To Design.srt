1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,110
 While learning goal is something we want you to know at the end of the course,

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,290
 a learning outcome is something we want you to be able to do.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,210
 This course really has one learning outcomes but

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,460
 there are some nuances to it.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,120
 The learning outcome for this course is to be able to design

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,090
 effective interactions between humans and computers.

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,450
 The first part of this learning outcome is to design.

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,940
 But what is design?

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,540
 Well for us design is going to take two forms.

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,760
 First, design is an activity where you're appl known principles

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,110
 to a new problem.

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,650
 For example we'll talk a lot about the importance of getting users to write

13
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,480
 kind of feedback at the right time.

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,530
 That's a plan of principle of feedback to some new design problem ww encounter.

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,770
 But design is a second form as well, design is also a process where

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,730
 you gather information, use it to develop design alternatives,

17
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,660
 evaluate them with users and revise them accordingly.

18
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,300
 When designing interface for some tasks,

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,095
 I would ask some potential users how they perform some task right now.

20
00:00:51,095 --> 00:00:54,140
 I develop multiple different ideas for how we can help them.

21
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,580
 I give those to the users to evaluate, and

22
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,750
 I will use the experiences to try to improve the interface on that time.

23
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,300
 So let's take an example of this.

24
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,830
 Imagine I was designing a new thermostat.

25
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,800
 On the one hand, designing a new thermostat means applying known

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,310
 HCR principles, like feedback and error tolerance to some new design.

27
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,990
 On the other hand, designing a new thermostat means creating

28
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,750
 different ideas, giving them to users, getting their feedback and

29
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,980
 then revising those designs.

30
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,410
 Both these sides of design are very important.

31
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,140
 You don't want to ignore

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,820
 decades of experience when designing new interfaces, but simply applying known

33
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,220
 principles to a new problem doesn't guarantee you have a good design.

34
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,100
 Designing is about both these things.

35
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,440
 And in fact, these two things are a vast majority of material that we'll cover in

36
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,420
 this course.

37
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,280
 We'll cover the principles uncovered by a human factors engineering and

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,220
 human computer interaction research.

39
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,150
 And we'll cover the methods used in the HCI.

40
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,630
 We're gathering user requirements, developing designs, and

41
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:45,630
 evaluating new interfaces.
