00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,670
 In this lesson, I've tried to give you

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,370
 some expectations of what this course will be like.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,065
 We've gone over the course's goals,

4
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:12,495
 outcomes, learning strategies, and assessments.

5
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:15,140
 We've covered the course's learning outcome in great detail,

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,910
 to design effective interactions between humans and computers.

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,350
 Now, I focus mostly on the video material because the assignments, projects,

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,090
 and exams are separate from these videos,

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,195
 and are likely to change pretty significantly semester to semester.

10
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:30,165
 The video material here will cover three general areas;

11
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:32,805
 principles, methods, and applications.

12
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:34,770
 To really get into the applications,

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,165
 it's useful to understand the principles and methods.

14
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:40,460
 But the same time, it's useful to keep the applications in mind,

15
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,710
 while learning about the principles and methods.

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,980
 So, next, we're going to briefly preview some of the application areas,

17
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,715
 for you to keep in mind during the rest of our conversations.

18
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,840
 Then, after we cover principles and methods,

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,150
 we'll invite you to revisit these application areas

20
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,150
 and leave room to explore whatever you find most interesting.
