 In education,

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,630
 a learning goal is something we want you to understand at the end of the course.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,450
 It's the knowledge contained within your head that you might not have had when we

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,720
 got started.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,610
 In this class we have three major learning goals.

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,600
 First, we want you to understand some of the common principles in

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,309
 human computer interaction.

8
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,480
 These are the tried and true rules on how to design good interactions between

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,490
 humans and computers.

10
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,210
 Second, we want you to understand design life cycle.

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,108
 That's how interfaces go from conception to prototypes to evaluation.

12
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:32,090
 And we especially want you to understand the roll of iteration in this process.

13
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,365
 Third, we want you to understand the expense of the human computer inherent

14
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:38,348
 interaction field and the current applications available for HCI.

15
00:00:38,348 --> 00:00:40,800
 HCI is really everywhere, from domains like healthcare,

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,060
 to technologies like virtual reality, to emerging techniques like sonification.

17
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,630
 We want you to understand the broad range of application areas for

18
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:47,630
 HCI in the modern world.
