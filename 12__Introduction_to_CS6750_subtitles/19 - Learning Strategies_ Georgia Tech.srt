1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,944
 Within the full course at Georgia Tech,

2
00:00:01,944 --> 00:00:05,270
 there are a number of other strategies in which you'll engage as well.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,170
 First, we're really passionate about leveraging the student community in

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,220
 this class to improve the experience for everyone.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,800
 Taking this class with you are people with experience in a variety of

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,800
 industries, many of whom have significant experience in HCI.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,020
 So some strategies we'll use include peer learning, collaborative learning,

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,325
 learning by teaching, and communities of practice.

9
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:26,002
 You'll learn both from each other and with each other.

10
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:28,920
 You'll play the role of student, teacher, and partner, and

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,110
 you will learn from each perspective.

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:31,630
 In addition,

13
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,360
 the entire course is built around the idea of project-based learning.

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,970
 Early in the semester, you'll form a team and start looking at a problem

15
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,530
 we've selected, or maybe one in which you're already interested.

16
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,720
 This project will then become the domain through which you explore the principles

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,540
 and methods of human-computer interaction.

18
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,940
 Who knows? By the end of the semester,

19
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,730
 you might even generate something with the potential to go forward

20
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:51,730
 as a real-world product, or as a research project.
