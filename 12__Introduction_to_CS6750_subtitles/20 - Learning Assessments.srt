1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,540
 Learning goals are what we want you to understand.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,330
 Learning outcomes or what we want you to be able to do.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,950
 Learning assessments then, are how we evaluate whether you can do what we want

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,050
 you to be able to do and understand what we want you to understand.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,059
 The learning outcome to this class is to be able to design

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,930
 effective interactions between humans and computers.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,510
 So the primary assessments in this class are to, say it with me,

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,860
 design effective interactions between humans and computers.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,590
 You'll start with some relatively small scale tasks, recommending improvements

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,165
 to existing interfaces or or undertaking some small design challenges.

11
00:00:33,165 --> 00:00:36,835
 But as the semester goes on, you'll scope up towards a bigger challenge.

12
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:39,195
 You'll initially investigate that challenge individually and

13
00:00:39,195 --> 00:00:40,955
 then you'll merge into teams to prototype and

14
00:00:40,955 --> 00:00:44,025
 evaluate a full solution to the challenge you chose.

15
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:48,225
 At the end, you'll be evaluated not just on the final design you generate but

16
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:48,225
 on the process by which it was generated.
