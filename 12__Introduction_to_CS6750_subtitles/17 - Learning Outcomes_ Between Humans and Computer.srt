1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,100
 The final part of our desired learning outcome is between humans and computers.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,120
 We want to design effective interactions between humans and computers.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,800
 Well, what is important to note here, is where we're placing the emphasis.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,960
 Note that we didn't say designing effective interfaces,

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,980
 because that puts the entire focus on the interface.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,200
 We're deeply interested in the human's role in this interaction.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,670
 So rather than designing interfaces,

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,080
 designing programs, designing tools, we're designing interactions.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,660
 We're designing tasks.

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,950
 We're designing how people accomplish their goals,

11
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,320
 not just the interface that they use to accomplish their goals.

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,110
 Take our thermostat for example.

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,520
 When we started this process, our goal shouldn't be to design a thermostat.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,170
 Our goal should be to design the way in which a person controls

15
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,920
 the temperature in their home.

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,360
 That subtle shift in emphasis is powerful.

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,451
 If you set out to design a better thermostat,

18
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:51,204
 you might design a wall-mounted device that's easier to read or easier to use.

19
00:00:51,204 --> 00:00:52,984
 But if you set to design a better way for

20
00:00:52,984 --> 00:00:57,000
 people to control the temperature in their home, you might end up with Nest.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,390
 A device that learns from the user and

22
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:58,390
 starts to control the temperature automatically.
