1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,370
 We'll close by talking about the overall structure of the content you'll be

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,570
 consuming.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,620
 The course's lessons are designed to be as independent as possible, so

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,080
 you should be able to skip around if you want,

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,870
 but there's a certain logic to our planned presentation order.

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,149
 We discussed earlier the model HCI, how design informs research and

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,010
 research then informs design, so

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,830
 we'll start by discussing some of the core design principles of HCI.

9
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,690
 Then we'll discuss the research methodologies for

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,280
 uncovering new user information, the interative design lifecycle.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,282
 We'll close by giving you the opportunity to peek at what's going on

12
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:30,282
 in the HCI community at large.
