1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,360
 A third view on the user is to look at the user as a participant in some

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,700
 environment.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,930
 That means we're not just interested in what's going on inside their head.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,830
 We're also interested in what's going on around them at the same time,

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,400
 like what other tasks or interfaces they're using, or

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,750
 what other people they're interacting with.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,300
 We want to understand for example, what's competing for their attention?

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,800
 What are their available cognitive resources?

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,170
 What's the importance of the task relative to everything else that's

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,600
 going on?

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,580
 So if we take this view, then our interface must fit with the context.

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,920
 It's not enough that the user is able to physically use the system and

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,790
 knows how to use the system.

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,880
 They must be able to actually interact with the system in the context

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,550
 where they need it.

16
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,700
 And because context is so

17
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,310
 important here, we evaluate it with in situ studies.

18
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,340
 We can't simply look at the user and the interface in a vacuum.

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,320
 We have to actually view and evaluate them in the real world

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,830
 using the interface in whatever context is most relevant.

21
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,700
 If we're evaluating a new GPS application, for example,

22
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,040
 we need to actually go out and

23
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,140
 look at it in the context of real drivers driving on real roads.

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,070
 The information we get from them using the app in our lab setting

25
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,170
 isn't as useful as understanding how they're going to actually use it

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,260
 out in the real world.

27
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,920
 These are in situ studies, which are studies of the interface and

28
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:14,920
 the user within the real complete context of the task.
