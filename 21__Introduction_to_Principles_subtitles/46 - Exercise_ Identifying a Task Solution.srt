1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,170
 If you said she's swiping her credit card,

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,590
 you're thinking a little too narrowly.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,180
 Swiping her credit card is just how she accomplishes her task.

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,132
 We're interested in something more like she's completing a purchase.

5
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:12,445
 She's purchasing an item.

6
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:14,218
 She's exchanging goods.

7
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:17,316
 Those all put more emphasis on the actual task she's accomplishing and

8
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:17,316
 let us think more generally about how we can make that interface even better.
