00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,770
 For me, we have a system at Udacity we use to record hours for

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,410
 those of us that work on some contract projects.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,400
 It asks us to enter the number of hours of the day we spend on each of a number

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,160
 of different types of work.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,440
 The problem is that,

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,680
 that assumes something closely resembling the processor model.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,870
 A computer can easily track how long different processes take.

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,250
 But for me, checking the amount of time spent on different tasks can be

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,308
 basically impossible.

10
00:00:23,308 --> 00:00:27,460
 Checking my e-mails involves switching between five different tasks a minute.

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,590
 How am I suppose to track that?

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,015
 The system doesn't take into consideration a realistic view

13
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:33,975
 of my role in the system.

14
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:36,765
 Something more similar to the predictor view would be, well,

15
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:38,515
 the classroom you're viewing this in.

16
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:41,865
 Surrounding this video are a visual organization of the lesson's content,

17
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:44,005
 a meter measuring your progress through the video,

18
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:46,265
 representations of the video's transcript.

19
00:00:46,265 --> 00:00:49,025
 These are all meant to equip you with the knowledge to predict what's coming

20
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:50,010
 next.

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,710
 This classroom takes a predictor view of the user.

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,480
 It offloads some of the cognitive load onto the interface

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,160
 allowing you to focus on the material.

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,720
 For the third view I personally would consider my alarm clock an example.

25
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,980
 I use an alarm clock app called Sleep.

26
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,030
 It monitors my sleep cycles, rings at the optimal time and

27
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,580
 tracks my sleep patterns to make recommendations.

28
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,050
 It understand its role as part of a broader system needed to help me sleep.

29
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,000
 It goes far beyond just interaction between me and an interface.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 It integrates into the entire system.
