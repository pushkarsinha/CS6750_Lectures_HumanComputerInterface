1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,410
 By my definition, user experience design is attempting to create systems that

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,550
 dictate how the user will experience them.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,620
 Preferably that the user will experience them positively.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,900
 User experience in general, though, is a phenomenon that emerges

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,020
 out of the interactions between humans and tasks via interfaces.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,210
 We might attempt to design that experience.

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,050
 But whether we design it or not, there is a user experience.

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,330
 It's kind of like the weather, there's never no weather,

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,770
 there's never no user experience.

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,300
 It might be a bad experience if we don't design it very well.

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,396
 But there's always some user experience going on and it emerges as a result of

12
00:00:33,396 --> 00:00:37,410
 the human's interactions with the task via the interface.

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,420
 But user experience also goes beyond this simple interaction.

14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,370
 It touches on the emotional, personal, and

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,710
 more experiential elements of the relationship.

16
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,500
 We can build this by expanding our understanding

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,390
 of the scope of the user experience.

18
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,800
 For just a particular individual, this is based on things like the individual's

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,220
 age, sex, or race, personal experiences, gender, expectations for

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,050
 the interface, and more.

21
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,140
 It goes beyond just designing an interface to help with a task.

22
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,800
 It touches on whether the individual feels like the interface was

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,180
 designed for them.

24
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,660
 It examines whether they're frustrated by the interface or joyous about it.

25
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,140
 Those are all parts of this user experience.

26
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,080
 We can take this further and talk about user experience at a group level.

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,670
 We can start to think about how interfaces lead to different user

28
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,720
 experiences among social or work groups.

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,260
 For example, I've known that school reunions seem to be much less important

30
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,160
 to people who've graduated within the past 15 years.

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,000
 And I hypothesize it's because Facebook and

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,090
 email have played such significant roles in keeping people in touch.

33
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,360
 It's fundamentally changed the social to group user experience.

34
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,060
 Those effects can then scope all the way up to the societal level.

35
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,660
 Sometimes these are unintended.

36
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,280
 For example, I doubt that the creators of Twitter, foresaw when they created

37
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,370
 their tool, how it would play a significant role in big societal changes

38
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,190
 like the Arab spring or, sometimes these might be intentional.

39
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,860
 For example, it was a significant change when Facebook added new relationship

40
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,060
 statuses to its profiles to reflect things like civil unions.

41
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,940
 That simultaneously reflected something that was already changing at

42
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,210
 the societal level.

43
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,690
 But it also participated in that change and

44
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,740
 helped normalize those kinds of relationships.

45
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,300
 And that then relates back to the individual by making sure

46
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,740
 the interface is designed such that each individual feels like it's actually

47
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,250
 designed with them in mind.

48
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,650
 The options are there for

49
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,720
 them to feel like they're properly represented within the system.

50
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,510
 These are all components of the general user experience

51
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:31,510
 that we need to think about as we design interfaces.
