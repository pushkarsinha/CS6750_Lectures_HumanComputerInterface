00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,770
 At the heart of Human Computer Interaction is the idea that users

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,010
 use interfaces to accomplish some task.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,550
 In general, that interface wouldn't actually have to be technological.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,410
 This cycle exists for things like using pencils to write things or

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,160
 using a steering wheel to drive a car.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,248
 But in HCI, we're going to focus on interfaces that are in some way

7
00:00:18,248 --> 00:00:20,410
 computational or computerized.

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,350
 What's most important here though is our focus on the interaction between

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,240
 the user and the task though the interface,

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,660
 not just the interaction between the user and the interface itself.

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,710
 We're designing interfaces, sure, but to design a good interface, we need to

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,690
 understand both the users goals and the tasks they're trying to accomplish.

13
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,830
 Understanding the task is really important.

14
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,340
 One of the mistakes many novice designers make,

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,620
 is jumping too quickly to the interface, without understanding the task.

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,220
 For example, think about designing a new thermostat.

17
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,480
 If you focus on the interface, the thermostat itself, you're going to

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,740
 focus on things like the placement of the buttons or the layout of the screen,

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,000
 on whether or not the user can actually read what's there, and things like that.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,200
 And those are all important questions.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,980
 But the task is controlling the temperature in an area.

22
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,768
 When you think about the task rather than just the interface,

23
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:12,540
 you think of things like nest,

24
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,620
 which is a device that tries to learn from its user and act autonomously.

25
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,190
 That's more than just an interface for controlling whether the heat or

26
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,950
 the air conditioning is on.

27
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,300
 That's an interface for controlling the temperature in your house.

28
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,083
 By focusing on the task instead of just the interface,

29
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:30,955
 we can come up with more revolutionary designs like the Nest rather than just

30
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:30,955
 iterative improvements to the same thermostats we've been using for years.
