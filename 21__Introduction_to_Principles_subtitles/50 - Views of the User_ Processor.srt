00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,770
 In looking at human-computer interaction, it's important that we

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,820
 understand the role that we expect the human to play in this overall system.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,865
 Let's talk about three different possible types of roles the human can

4
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:16,260
 play, processor, predictor, and participant.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,810
 First, we might think of the human as being nothing more than a sensory

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:20,790
 processor.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,530
 They take input in and they spit output out.

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,300
 They're kind of like another computer in the system,

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,070
 just one that we can't see the inside of.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,490
 If we are designing with this role in mind then our main concern is that

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,170
 the interface fit within known human limits.

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,550
 These are things like what humans can sense,

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,840
 what they can store in memory, and what they can physically do in the world.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,730
 In this case, usability means that the interface is physically usable.

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,210
 User can see all the colors, touch all the buttons, and so on.

16
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,280
 With this model,

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,070
 we evaluate our interfaces with quantitative experiments.

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,470
 That means we take numeric measurements on how quickly the user can complete

19
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,410
 some task or how quickly they might react to some incoming stimulus.

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,670
 Now, as you might have guessed, the processor view is not the one we'll

21
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,240
 generally take when we talk about good design.

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,460
 Instead, we'll probably divide our time pretty equally between the other two

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:10,460
 perspectives.
