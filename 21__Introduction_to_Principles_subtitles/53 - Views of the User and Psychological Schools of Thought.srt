1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,925
 So, where did these different views of the user come from?

2
00:00:02,925 --> 00:00:07,740
 To find out, we actually need to trace HCI back to its roots in psychology.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,420
 The processor view of the user goes back to the behaviorist school of psychology.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,310
 Behaviorism was the dominant school of thought in

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,695
 psychology throughout the late 19th century.

6
00:00:16,695 --> 00:00:19,080
 It aimed to provide a systematic way of

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,170
 investigating behaviors in humans and in other animals.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,150
 It was largely established by John B.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,135
 Watson who was a psychologist at Columbia University.

10
00:00:27,135 --> 00:00:32,430
 He insisted that psychology focus only on observable behavior and not on introspection.

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,470
 John B. Watson himself was responsible for

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,215
 the "Little Albert" experiment that you might be familiar with.

13
00:00:37,215 --> 00:00:40,190
 In that experiment, a little boy was conditioned to be afraid

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,210
 of rabbits as they were repeatedly paired with loud noises.

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,565
 You might be familiar with some of the other big names in behaviorism as well,

16
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:49,700
 such as Pavlov with his dogs and Skinner with his rats.

17
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,720
 Pavlov discovered the idea of classical conditioning where he could condition a dog to

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,950
 salivate at the sound of a bell by repeatedly pairing those two stimuli together.

19
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,470
 Skinner went step further with operant conditioning and

20
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,530
 conditioned rats to actually demonstrate a learned behavior.

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,765
 They would press a button to receive food.

22
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,300
 The important takeaway here is that Behaviorism

23
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,590
 focuses only on observable behaviors and outcomes.

24
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,800
 It attempts to understand behavior by looking only at behavior,

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,380
 not at the cognition that underlies behavior,

26
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,480
 and thus it has the name, "Behaviorism."

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,930
 In HCI, this means looking at what designs create

28
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,265
 the right behaviors without paying a whole lot of attention as to why.

29
00:01:28,265 --> 00:01:30,920
 If we view the user as a processor,

30
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,705
 that our design process focuses on testing observable behaviors.

31
00:01:34,705 --> 00:01:36,590
 The predictor view of the user goes back to

32
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,830
 the next major school of thought in psychology,

33
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,270
 Cognitivism, or Cognitive psychology or Cognitive science.

34
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,065
 While Behaviorism was only concerned with what we could observe,

35
00:01:45,065 --> 00:01:49,265
 Cognitivism is concerned with what goes on inside the mind.

36
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:50,465
 Now, this covers a lot,

37
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:52,650
 things like perception, attention,

38
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:56,475
 memory, creativity, these all occur inside the user's mind.

39
00:01:56,475 --> 00:02:00,140
 Cognitivism started out more as a philosophical endeavor.

40
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,490
 Philosophers like Rene Descartes and Immanuel Kant touched on questions

41
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,600
 like whether knowledge is inborn or developed solely by experience,

42
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,760
 whether or not people are blank slates when they're

43
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,280
 born or if they're born with some kind of innate knowledge.

44
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,150
 But it wasn't until the cognitive revolution of the 1950s that

45
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,230
 Cognitivism really emerged as a foil to Behaviorism.

46
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,130
 At that time, it was such a radical departure than in many places,

47
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,559
 you still see Cognitive science classified

48
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:30,275
 as a completely different field from psychology.

49
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:34,010
 What's particularly interesting is that this shift came about in large part due to

50
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,285
 the work of scientists working in artificial intelligence and computer science,

51
00:02:38,285 --> 00:02:42,680
 as well as neuroscience and linguistics and some other areas that were applicable to

52
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,075
 psychology but weren't inside or weren't subsets of psychology.

53
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:49,580
 Some of the big names in Cognitivism are the linguist,

54
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,540
 Noam Chomsky, the psychologist,

55
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,760
 Susan Carey, and the computer scientists,

56
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,350
 John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky,

57
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,110
 Allen Newell, and Herbert Simon.

58
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,770
 Many of these might be names you're familiar with if you've read about classical AI.

59
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,950
 These are some of the biggest names in classical AI thinking.

60
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,680
 Those early efforts in classical AI were specifically

61
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,725
 trying to create computers that could think like humans.

62
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:12,620
 In order to create a computer that could think like a human,

63
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,840
 we had to understand how a human thought.

64
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,470
 Now, for us here in HCI,

65
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,225
 the key here is that we care about what the user is thinking.

66
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:25,130
 We call this the predictor model of the user because predicting is a mental process,

67
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,770
 and we want to know what the user is predicting.

68
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,110
 We ask questions like,

69
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,330
 what do they predict the outcome of that action will be?

70
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,265
 What do they predict is the right action to take?

71
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:40,025
 Notice here, the user is doing the predicting, not the interface.

72
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:42,650
 We want to get inside the user's head and

73
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,829
 understand how they predict the interface will behave.

74
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:48,380
 That's the core of the predictor model.

75
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,630
 Now, while Behaviorism and Cognitivism are

76
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,075
 well-established schools of thought in psychology,

77
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:55,790
 the participant view is a little more nascent.

78
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,610
 It resembles the functionalism view of psychology,

79
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:03,835
 which emphasizes examining mental behaviors in the context of broader environments.

80
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:06,440
 It also resembles system psychology which

81
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,455
 emphasizes human behavior within complex systems.

82
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:12,590
 But in both places, the coupling between the participant view in

83
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,830
 these schools of thought is little less well-defined.

84
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,740
 In our work, the participant view largely comes out of

85
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,115
 original research in HCI and human factors engineering.

86
00:04:22,115 --> 00:04:25,160
 The important thing here is that while the processor and predictor views

87
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,160
 emphasize only the interaction of some user and some interface,

88
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,865
 the participant view also looks at the interaction of

89
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:34,715
 both within the context of a larger system.

90
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:39,185
 It cares about the environment in which the user and the interface are situated.

91
00:04:39,185 --> 00:04:42,230
 So, this model views the user and the interface as

92
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,530
 participants within a larger complex cognitive system.

93
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,650
 Some of the major names in this area are Edwin Hutchins,

94
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,970
 who pioneered the idea of distributed cognition.

95
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,680
 We'll talk about him more when we talk about distributed cognition in a few lessons.

96
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,880
 Lucy Suchman also introduced the idea of situated action models,

97
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,590
 which argue that we can't disentangle

98
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,610
 behavior from the environment in which it takes place.

99
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,420
 Gavriel Salomon was an educational psychologist who focused in large part on how

100
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,700
 learning happens in the context of culturally provided tools and implements,

101
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,810
 and Bonnie Nardi introduced the complimentary idea of activity theory into

102
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,030
 this general idea of analyzing a user and

103
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,050
 an interface as participants in some larger activity.

104
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,329
 So, anytime you're looking beyond just the user and the interface,

105
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:29,285
 you're likely employing the participant view in some way.

106
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:31,460
 But like I said, we'll talk about this a lot more when

107
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,700
 we reach our lesson on distributed cognition.

108
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,840
 Now, this has been a super quick recap of

109
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,530
 these three major schools of thought in both psychology and in HCI.

110
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,810
 There are actually entire classes available to focus

111
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,760
 exclusively on each of these or even on subparts of each of these.

112
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,030
