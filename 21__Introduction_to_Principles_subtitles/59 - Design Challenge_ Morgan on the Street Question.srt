00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,300
 So keeping in mind everything we've talked about,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,400
 let's design something for Morgan.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,090
 Morgan walks to work, she likes to listen to audiobooks,

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,530
 mostly non fiction.

5
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,540
 But she doesn't just want to listen, she wants to be able to take notes and

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,150
 leave bookmarks.

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,380
 And do everything else you do when you're reading.

8
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,070
 What would designing for her look like, from the perspectives of viewing her as

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,450
 a processor, a predictor, and a participant?

10
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,660
 How much this different designs affect user experience as an individual in

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,230
 her local group of friends.

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:25,230
 And the society as a whole if the design caught on.
