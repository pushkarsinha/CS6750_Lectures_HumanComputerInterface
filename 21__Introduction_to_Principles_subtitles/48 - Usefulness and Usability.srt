00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,430
 The ultimate goal of design in HCI is to create interfaces that are both useful

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,030
 and useable.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,060
 Useful means that the interface allows the user to achieve some task,

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,190
 but usefulness is a pretty low bar.

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,670
 For example, a map is useful in finding your way from one place to another, but

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,200
 it isn't the most useable thing in the world.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,730
 You have to keep track of where you are, you have to plot your own route.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,240
 And you have to do all of this while driving the car.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,400
 So before GPS navigation, people would often manually write down the turns

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,970
 before they actually started driving somewhere that they hadn't been before.

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,470
 So our big concern is usability.

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,670
 That's where we get things like navigation apps.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,470
 Notice how we have to focus on understanding the task when we're

14
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,910
 performing design.

15
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,810
 If we set out to design a better map.

16
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,560
 We probably wouldn't have ended up with a navigation app.

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,510
 It was through understanding the task of navigation itself that we realized we

18
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,480
 could offload a lot of the cognitive load of navigation onto the interface,

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:54,480
 closing the loop between the user and the task of navigation.
