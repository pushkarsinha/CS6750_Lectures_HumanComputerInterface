1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,240
 As a processor, we might simply look at what information is communicated to

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,570
 Morgan, when, and how.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,230
 As a predictor, we might look instead at how the interface

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,800
 meshes with Morgan's needs with regard to this task, how easy it is to access,

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,640
 how easy the commands are to perform, and so on.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,030
 As a participant, we might look at the broader interactions between this

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,220
 interface and Morgan's other tasks and social activities.

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,260
 You might look at how increased access to books changes her life in other ways.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,700
 But really, this challenge is too big to address this quickly.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,930
 So instead, let's return to this challenge throughout our conversations,

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:32,930
 and use it as a running dialogue to explore HCI principles and methods.
