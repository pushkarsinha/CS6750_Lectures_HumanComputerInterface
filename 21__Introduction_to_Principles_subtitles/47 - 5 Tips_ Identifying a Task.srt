 Here are five quick tips for identifying a user task.

2
00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:09,315
 Number one: watch real users.

3
00:00:09,315 --> 00:00:11,670
 Instead of just speculating or brainstorming,

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,240
 get out there and watch real users performing in the area in which you're interested.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,670
 Number two: talk to them.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,220
 You don't have to just watch them.

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,740
 Recruit some participants to come perform the task and talk their way through it.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,055
 Find out what they're thinking, what their goals are, what their motives are.

9
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:28,640
 Number three: start small.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,520
 Start by looking at the individual little interactions.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,460
 It's tempting to come in believing you already understand the task,

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,660
 but if you do, you'll interpret everything you see in terms of what you already believe.

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,740
 Instead, start by looking at the smallest operators a user performs.

14
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,435
 Number four: abstract up.

15
00:00:45,435 --> 00:00:47,810
 Working from those small observations try to

16
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,930
 abstract up to an understanding of the tasks that they're trying to complete.

17
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,580
 Keep asking why they're performing

18
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,205
 these actions until you get beyond the scope of your design.

19
00:00:55,205 --> 00:00:58,680
 For example, what is Morgan doing? Swiping her credit card.

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,600
 Why? To make a purchase.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,685
 Why? To acquire some goods.

22
00:01:02,685 --> 00:01:04,880
 Why? To repair her car.

23
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,675
 Somewhere in that sequence is likely the task for which we want to design.

24
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:11,810
 Number five: you are not your user.

25
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,765
 Even if you yourself perform the task for which you're designing,

26
00:01:14,765 --> 00:01:16,270
 you're not designing for you.

27
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,995
 You're designing for everyone that performs that task.

28
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:23,020
 So, leave behind your own previous experiences and preconceived notions about it.

29
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,870
 These five quick tips come up a lot in the methods unit of HCI.

30
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,510
 HCI research methods are largely about understanding users,

31
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,355
 their motivations, and their tasks.

32
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:31,355
 So we'll talk much more about this later but it's good to keep in mind now.
