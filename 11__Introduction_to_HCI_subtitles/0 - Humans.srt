 This is Morgan.

00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,200
 >> Hello.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,160
 >> Morgan is a human.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,100
 >> Last time I checked.

00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,910
 >> As a human, Morgan has various ways of perceiving the world around her,

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,370
 like seeing, hearing, and feeling.

 >> Is anyone else seeing these?

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,960
 >> There area few more as well like smelling and tasting,

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,160
 but we won't deal with those as much.

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,520
 >> Thank goodness.

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,050
 >> But Morgan has more than senses.

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,415
 She also has memories, experiences, skills, knowledge.

00:00:36,415 --> 00:00:38,005
 >> Thanks.

00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:41,335
 >> In human computer interaction, we have to take into consideration every

16
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:44,525
 element of the human, from the way they perceive and interact with the world,

17
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:44,525
 to their long history of using computers and technology.
