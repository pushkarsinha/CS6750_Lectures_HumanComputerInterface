1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,090
 So, now you know what we're going to cover in our exploration of HCI.

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,690
 We're going to talk about some of the fundamental design principles

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,045
 that HCI researchers have discovered over the years.

4
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,620
 We're going to talk about performing user research whether it'll

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,445
 be for new interfaces or exploring human cognition.

6
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:19,925
 We're going to talk about the relationship between these two,

7
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:21,860
 how our research informs what we design,

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,295
 and how what we design helps us conducted research,

9
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:26,210
 and we're going to talk about how these principles work,

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,430
 in a lot of domains from technologies

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,025
 like augmented reality to disciplines like healthcare.

12
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:33,340
 I hope you're excited. I know I am.

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,100
 I like to think of this not just as a course about human-computer interaction,

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,650
 but also an example of human computer interaction.

15
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,960
 Humans are using computers in new and engaging

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,085
 ways to teach about human-computer interaction.

17
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:47,495
 We hope this course exemplifies the principles,

18
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:47,495
 as well as teaches them.
