1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,110
 This is a computer.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,120
 Or at least, this is probably what you think of

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,960
 when you think of the term computer.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,850
 But this is also a computer.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,603
 And so is this.

6
00:00:12,603 --> 00:00:13,105
 And so is this.

7
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:13,610
 And so is this.

8
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,801
 And so is this.

9
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:17,960
 >> Hey!

10
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,655
 >> This is Amanda, my video producer.

11
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,170
 >> Go on, I'm rolling.

12
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,830
 >> Right, and so is this.

13
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:30,580
 And so is this, and this, and this, and this, and even this.

14
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,780
 And so is this.

15
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,008
 And so is this.

16
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:34,724
 And so is this.

17
00:00:34,724 --> 00:00:35,629
 [SOUND] And so is this.

18
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:39,612
 And so is this.

19
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:41,230
 Hey David?

20
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,720
 >> One second, trying to get to Squirtle.

21
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,270
 There we go.

22
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,390
 With mobile devices and

23
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,310
 augmented reality, HCI is quite literally everything.

24
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,920
 Pokemon Go was released a few days before I recorded this and

25
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,160
 augmented reality games like this turn effectively the entire world

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,880
 into an instance of HCI.

27
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,540
 Even out here in the middle of nowhere,

28
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:01,540
 I'm still doing something with computers.
