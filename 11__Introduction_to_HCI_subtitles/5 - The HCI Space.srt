00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,230
 One of the most exciting parts of HCI is it's incredible ubiquity.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,140
 Computers are all around us and we interact with them everyday.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,310
 It's exciting to think about designing the types of tools and

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,862
 interfaces we spend so much time dealing with, but there's a danger here too.

5
00:00:13,862 --> 00:00:15,740
 Because we're all humans interacting with computers,

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,470
 we think we're experts at human-computer interaction.

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,330
 But that's not the case.

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,200
 We might be experts at interacting with computers, but that doesn't make us

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,520
 experts at designing interactions between other humans and computers.

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,560
 We're like professional athletes or world-class scientists.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,840
 Just because we're experts doesn't mean we know how to help other people also

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,250
 become experts.

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,180
 In my experience, many people look at HCI like this.

14
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,850
 The red dot represents what they know and

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,800
 the black circle represents what they think there's to know.

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,350
 They know there's probably somethings they don't know yet, but they're

17
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,540
 already pretty at it, and it wouldn't be too hard to become an expert.

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,760
 After studying HCI for a bit though, they look more like this.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,780
 You can see that they've increased what they know but

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,250
 their perception of what there is to know has grown even more.

21
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,330
 That's the journey we'll be taking together.

22
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,430
 You'll learn to do work in HCI, but perhaps more importantly,

23
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,730
 you'll learn how complex and large the field of HCI is.

24
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,820
 Your knowledge will increase, but yet you might exit the class

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,680
 less confident in your HCI ability than when you started.

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:11,680
 You're taking the first step into a larger world.
