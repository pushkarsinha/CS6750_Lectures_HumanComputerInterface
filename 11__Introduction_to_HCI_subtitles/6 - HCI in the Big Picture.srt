1
00:00:00,193 --> 00:00:03,825
 Now, what we've described so far is a huge field,

2
00:00:03,825 --> 00:00:06,451
 far too big to cover in any one class.

3
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:10,007
 In fact there are lots of places where you can get an entire masters degree or

4
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:11,764
 PhD in human computer interaction.

5
00:00:11,764 --> 00:00:14,345
 Here are some of the schools that offer programs like that.

6
00:00:14,345 --> 00:00:18,066
 And these are just the school that offer actual degree programs in HCI,

7
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:21,231
 not computer science degrees with specializations in HCI,

8
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:24,039
 which would be almost any computer science program.

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:26,768
 So let's look more closely at what we're interested in for

10
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:28,577
 the purpose of the next several weeks.

11
00:00:28,577 --> 00:00:33,582
 To do that, let's look at where HCI sits in a broader hierarchy of fields.

12
00:00:33,582 --> 00:00:37,984
 We can think of HCI as a subset of a broader field of human factors

13
00:00:37,984 --> 00:00:39,071
 engineering.

14
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:42,503
 Human factors engineering is interested in a lot of the same ideas that

15
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:43,675
 we're interested in.

16
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:46,706
 But they aren't just interested in computers.

17
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:49,864
 Then there are also sub disciplines within HCI.

18
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:51,815
 This is just one way to represent this.

19
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:56,269
 Some people, for example, would put UI design under UX design, or put UX design

20
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:59,950
 on the same level as HCI, but this is the way I choose to present it.

21
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,316
 Generally, these use many of the same principles that we use in HCI,

22
00:01:03,316 --> 00:01:05,868
 but they might apply them to a more narrow domain, or

23
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:07,841
 they might have their own principles and

24
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:11,405
 methods that they use in addition to what we talk about in HCI in general.

25
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,430
 So to get a feel for what we're talking about when we discuss HCI,

26
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:14,430
 let's compare it to these other different fields.
