00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,390
 Video games actually give us some great examples of interfaces

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,800
 becoming invisible.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,570
 A good video game is really characterized by the player feeling like

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,300
 they're actually inside the game world,

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,590
 as opposed to controlling it by pressing some buttons on a controller.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,880
 We can do that through some intuitive controller design like

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,580
 pressing forward moves forward, and pressing backward moves backwards.

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,710
 But a lot of times we'll rely on the user to also learn how to control

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,500
 the game over time.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,410
 But as they learn, it becomes invisible between them and their interaction.

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,830
 A classic example of a place where interaction is more visible,

12
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,030
 is the idea of having more than one remote control that controls what

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,510
 feels like the same system.

14
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,770
 So I have these two controllers that control my TV and my cable box together.

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,350
 And for me it feels like this is just one task, watching TV.

16
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,450
 But technologically, it's actually different tasks.

17
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,047
 So I have to think about am I using the number pad on this controller or

18
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,870
 this controller, depending on what I'm trying to do at a given time.

19
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,632
 So I spend a lot of time thinking about the interface and

20
00:00:52,632 --> 00:00:52,632
 not as much thinking about the task.
