1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,130
 We have humans and we have computers and

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,780
 we're interested in the interaction between them.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,970
 That interaction can take different forms though.

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,780
 The most obvious seems to be the human interacts with the computer and

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,740
 the computer interacts with the human in response.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,620
 They go back and forth interacting, and that's a valid view.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,450
 But it perhaps misses the more interesting part of HCI.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,670
 We can also think of the human interacting with the task,

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,180
 through the computer.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,570
 The interaction is really between the human and the task and

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,690
 the computer in the middle just mediates that interaction.

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,970
 Or to put this differently, the human and

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,350
 the computer together, interact with the task.

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,320
 Ideally in this case, we're interested in making the interface as

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,190
 invisible as possible, so the user can spend as little time focusing on

16
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,920
 the interface and instead focus on the tasks that they're trying to accomplish.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,880
 Realistically, our interfaces are likely to stay somewhat visible.

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,590
 But our goal is to let the user spend as much time as possible thinking about

19
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,860
 the task, instead of thinking about our interface.

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,530
 We can all probably remember times when we've interacted with a piece of

21
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,850
 software and

22
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,580
 we felt like we spent all our time thinking about how to work the software.

23
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,330
 As opposed to accomplishing what we were using the software to do in

24
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,840
 the first place and that's frustrating.

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,500
 So our goal as designers,

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,050
 is to help the human feel like they're interacting directly with that task.

27
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:23,050
 While our interface, kind of vanishes, in the middle of that interaction.
