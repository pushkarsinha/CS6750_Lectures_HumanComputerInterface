00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,435
 For many years,

2
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:06,070
 human-computer interaction was largely about user interface design.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,790
 The earliest innovations in HCI were the creation of things like the light pen,

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,850
 the first computer mouse, which allow for

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,450
 flexible interaction with things on screen.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,080
 But the focus was squarely on the screen.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,370
 And so, we developed many principles about how to design things nicely

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,350
 for a screen.

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,590
 We borrowed from the magazine and print industries and identify the value of

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,540
 grids in displaying content and guiding the users eyes around our interfaces.

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,340
 We created laws that govern how difficult it is for

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,120
 users to select what they want on screen.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,340
 We examined for example whether it's easier to select a menu on a Mac,

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,520
 where the menus are always at the top of the screen.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,020
 Or on a PC, where they're grouped with the individual window.

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,000
 We develop techniques for

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,150
 helping interfaces adapt to different screen sizes and we develop methods for

18
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,630
 rapidly prototyping user interfaces using pen and paper or wire frames.

19
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,080
 Through this rich history,

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,540
 UI design really became its own well defined field.

21
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,230
 In fact, many of the concepts we'll cover in HCI

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,320
 were originally developed in the context of UI design.

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,160
 But in HCI, we're interested in things that go beyond the user's

24
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,720
 interaction with a single screen.

25
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,730
 Technically, you an cover that in UI design as well, but traditionally most

26
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,930
 of the UI design classes I see focus on on-screen interaction.

27
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,900
 In HCI, we'll talk about the more general methods that apply to

28
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:22,900
 any interface.
