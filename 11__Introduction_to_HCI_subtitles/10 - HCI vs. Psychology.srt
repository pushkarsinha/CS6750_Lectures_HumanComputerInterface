1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,610
 The research side of HCI connects to the relationship between HCI and psychology.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,160
 And if we zoom out even further on this hierarchy of disciplines,

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,940
 we might say that human factors engineering itself

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,510
 is in many ways the merger of engineering and psychology.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,650
 As well as other fields of design and cognitive science.

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,363
 In HCI, the engineering side takes the form of software engineering, but

7
00:00:24,363 --> 00:00:29,550
 this connection to psychology remains, and in fact, it's symbiotic.

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,200
 We use our understanding of psychology, of human perception,

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,050
 of cognition to inform the way we design interfaces.

10
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,610
 We then use our evaluations of those interfaces to reflect

11
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,110
 on our understanding of psychology itself.

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,560
 In fact, at Georgia Tech, the Human Computer Interaction class is cross

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,690
 listed as a Computer Science and Psychology class.

14
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,608
 So let's take an example of this.

15
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:54,155
 In 1992, psychologists working at Apple wanted to study

16
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:58,410
 how people organized the rapid flow of information in their work spaces.

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,800
 They observed that people tended to form piles of related material,

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,170
 kind of like a less formal filing system, and so

19
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,030
 they then designed a computer interface, that would mimic that ability.

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,250
 Finally, they used the results of that development to reflect on how people

21
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,430
 were managing their work spaces in the first place.

22
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,550
 So in the end, they had a better understanding of the thought processes

23
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,880
 of their users as well as an interface that actually helped users.

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,250
 So in the end, their design of an interface with an HCI

25
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,710
 informed their understanding of psychology more generally.

26
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,860
 We came away with a better understanding of the way humans think about their work

27
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,180
 spaces because of our experience designing something

28
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,180
 that was supposed to help them think about their work spaces.
