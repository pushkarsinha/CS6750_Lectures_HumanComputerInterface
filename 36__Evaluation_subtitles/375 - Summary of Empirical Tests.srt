1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
 Because the only goal here is for you to be able to identify what test to use and when,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,110
 we've put together this little chart to serve as kind of a cheat sheet.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,420
 Here, you can look up your independent variable,

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,425
 your dependent variable and your number of treatments and see what test is recommended.

5
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:16,425
 So, if you've gathered some categorical ordinal data,

6
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:17,790
 with three or more treatments,

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,220
 I'd probably want to use a Chi-squared test.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,065
 Now of course, you'll also notice that this isn't exhaustive.

9
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,380
 There are a lot of combinations of

10
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,400
 independent and dependent variables you could have that aren't covered here.

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,300
 For example, we never talked about how you do

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,625
 a binomial test with three or more treatments.

13
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:35,105
 You might also have tests for the independent variables interval or ratio

14
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:38,745
 but your deep in the variable is still nominal or ordinal or something else.

15
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:40,400
 So, there are a lot of things out there in

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,540
 the statistical community that aren't covered here.

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,500
 But these tests and these combinations of variables,

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,695
 tend to be the ones that we encounter most often in HCI.

19
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:51,005
 Even there, this is probably overkill.

20
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:53,210
 A Chi-squared test, a T-test and

21
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,870
 the occasional ANOVA will probably last you your entire career.

22
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:56,870
 At least for the types of analyses that we usually care about.
