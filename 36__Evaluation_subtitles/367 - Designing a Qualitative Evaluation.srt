1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
 Let's run through some of the questions you'll have to

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,290
 answer in designing a qualitative evaluation.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,004
 First, is this based on prior experience,

4
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:09,015
 or is it a live demonstration?

5
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:11,370
 If you're bringing in users to answer questions about

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,950
 some interface that they're already using regularly,

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,530
 I'd probably argue you're actually doing need-finding.

8
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,240
 Now, the distinction can be subtle because

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,654
 evaluation does lead to additional need-finding,

10
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:24,105
 but most of these questions are going to apply more to a live demonstration.

11
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:28,665
 This is where you're bringing users in to test out some new interface for new prototype.

12
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:32,395
 Second, is the session going to be synchronous or asynchronous?

13
00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:33,895
 In a synchronous session,

14
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:36,200
 you're sitting and watching the user live.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,415
 You're actually watching them use this interface you use in this prototype.

16
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:42,335
 If they're going to complete it on their own and just send you the results,

17
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:44,245
 and then it's an asynchronous session.

18
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:46,580
 Synchronous is usually beneficial because we see

19
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,340
 a much greater amount of the interactions taking place.

20
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,865
 We might also be able to interrupt the user and get their thoughts live.

21
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:55,760
 Asynchronous, though is often much easier to carry out,

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,680
 especially with larger populations.

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,410
 I generally recommend synchronous whenever possible,

24
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,915
 but asynchronous is certainly better than nothing.

25
00:01:02,915 --> 00:01:07,075
 Third, how many prototypes or how many interfaces will they be evaluating?

26
00:01:07,075 --> 00:01:10,234
 You might have users come in to evaluate only one interface,

27
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:13,570
 or you might have them look at multiple prototypes to compare between them.

28
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,905
 If you're having them look at more than one prototype,

29
00:01:15,905 --> 00:01:20,030
 you want to make sure to vary the order in which you present them, otherwise,

30
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,580
 you might get consistently different feedback just because the user is

31
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,610
 already familiar with the problem domain when they get to the second interface.

32
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,920
 That can be particularly significant if you're trying out

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,670
 some new interface compared to an interface that you've used in the past.

34
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,070
 If you always present the old first,

35
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,310
 then you'll probably get a lot of users saying the new one is much better,

36
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,385
 when in reality, they're just more familiar with the problem now.

37
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:43,615
 Fourth, when do you want to get feedback from the user?

38
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:46,175
 There are two main protocols for doing this.

39
00:01:46,175 --> 00:01:49,175
 There's a Think Aloud Protocol and a Post-Event Protocol.

40
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,795
 In a Think Aloud Protocol,

41
00:01:50,795 --> 00:01:52,730
 you ask the user to actually think out loud

42
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,985
 while they're using your interface or prototype.

43
00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:58,470
 You ask him to explain what they're seeing and explain how they interpreted,

44
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,285
 and explain what they think the outcome of their actions will be.

45
00:02:01,285 --> 00:02:02,540
 In a Post-Event Protocol,

46
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,535
 you have the user go through some session

47
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:07,220
 using the interface or testing out the prototype,

48
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,380
 and then only giving you thoughts at the end.

49
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,629
 A Post-Event Protocol has the drawback,

50
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:14,155
 that you're only getting the user's feedback at the end.

51
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:16,490
 So, if they experience some difficulty early on,

52
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,580
 they may have forgotten it by the time you actually get feedback from them,

53
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,410
 but a Think Aloud Protocol has a problem,

54
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,705
 and then it might introduce some new biases.

55
00:02:23,705 --> 00:02:27,770
 Research shows that when users are asked to think out loud while using an interface,

56
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,100
 the way they use the interface actually changes.

57
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,840
 They're more deliberative. They're more thoughtful.

58
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,985
 They're less intuitive about their interactions.

59
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:35,775
 In general, what that means,

60
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:39,500
 is that when we ask users to think out loud about an interface, oftentimes,

61
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,630
 they'll figure out how the interface works, but then,

62
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,360
 if users use the same interface without having to think out loud,

63
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,875
 they find it much more confusing.

64
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,800
 Talking through their thought process helps them understand,

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,375
 but our real end-users aren't going to talk through their thought process,

66
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,575
 so it's often good to use a mix of these two.

67
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:57,680
 In fact, I'd usually suggest doing a Think Aloud Protocol earlier,

68
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,630
 and using a Post-Event Protocol more as

69
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:04,540
 a summative evaluation once you're already pretty confident in how good your interfaces,

70
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,210
 but others advice may differ.

71
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,545
 In either case, it's worth noting that users are not

72
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:13,295
 often very good at explaining why they like something or why they did something,

73
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:16,435
 so we should always take the feedback that we get with a grain of salt.

74
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:20,585
 Finally, do you want to get feedback from individuals or from groups?

75
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:24,605
 Focus groups are used when multiple users talk together about their experiences.

76
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,690
 This can actually lead to better explanations,

77
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,459
 because users build on each other and expand each other's ideas,

78
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,080
 but it can also strongly biased the group

79
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,425
 towards the opinions of the most powerful personalities.

80
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:40,280
 Individual interviews and surveys force the user to be the only source of knowledge,

81
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,085
 which can be bad, but it also means the user isn't biased by other outside views.

82
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:47,390
 As you'll notice and has probably become a trend,

83
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,280
 whenever we talk about multiple different options for

84
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,395
 doing evaluation or need-finding or whatever,

85
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:53,165
 different approaches have different strengths,

86
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:55,749
 and they address the weaknesses of other approaches.

87
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:59,750
 So, generally, if you're going through multiple iterations of the design life cycle,

88
00:03:59,750 --> 00:03:59,750
 you'll probably use all of these different ideas at different times.
