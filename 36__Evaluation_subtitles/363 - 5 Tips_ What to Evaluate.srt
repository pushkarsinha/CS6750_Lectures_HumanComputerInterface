00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:08,385
 In designing evaluations, it's critical that we define what we're evaluating.

2
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:11,310
 Without that, we generally tend to bottom out

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,430
 in vague assessments about whether or not users like our interface.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,870
 So, here are five quick tips on what you might choose to evaluate.

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,600
 Number one, efficiency.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,825
 How long does it take users to accomplish certain tasks?

7
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:28,230
 That's one of the classic metrics for evaluating interfaces.

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,065
 Can one interface accomplish a task in pure actions or in less time than another?

9
00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:35,600
 You might test this with predictive models or you might

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,840
 actually time users in completing these tasks.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,740
 Still though, this paints a pretty narrow picture of usability.

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,410
 Number two, accuracy.

13
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,845
 How many errors do users commit while accomplishing a task?

14
00:00:48,845 --> 00:00:51,470
 That's typically a pretty empirical question

15
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,740
 although we can address it qualitatively as well.

16
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,570
 Ideally, we want an interface that reduces

17
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,690
 the number of errors a user commits while performing a task.

18
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,150
 Both efficiency and accuracy, however,

19
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,049
 examined the narrow setting of an expert user using an interface.

20
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:07,955
 So, that brings us to our next metric.

21
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:10,625
 Number three, learnability.

22
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,085
 Sit under user down in front of the interface.

23
00:01:13,085 --> 00:01:15,860
 Define some standard for expertise.

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,720
 How long does it take the user to hit that level of expertise?

25
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,640
 Expertise here might range from performing

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,195
 a particular action to something like creating an entire document.

27
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:29,110
 Number four, memorability.

28
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,760
 Similar to learnability,

29
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,420
 memorability refers to the user's ability to remember how to use an interface over time.

30
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,670
 Imagine you have a user alone in an interface,

31
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,965
 then leave and come back a week later.

32
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:41,860
 How much do they remember?

33
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,290
 Ideally, you want interfaces that need only be learned once,

34
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,555
 which means high memorability.

35
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:50,600
 Number five, satisfaction.

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,580
 When we forget to look at our other metrics,

37
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,720
 we bought them out in a general notion of satisfaction.

38
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,725
 But that doesn't mean it's unimportant.

39
00:01:57,725 --> 00:02:00,065
 We do need to operationalize it though.

40
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:03,020
 Experience is things like uses enjoyment of

41
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,595
 the system or the cognitive load they experience while using the system.

42
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:08,780
 To avoid social desirability bias,

43
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,230
 we might want to evaluate this in creative ways like finding out,

44
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,550
 how many participants actually download an app they tested after the session is over?

45
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,830
 Regardless of what you choose to evaluate,

46
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,010
 it's important that you very clearly articulate at the beginning,

47
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,650
 what you're evaluating, what data you're gathering,

48
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,885
 and what analysis you will use.

49
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:26,885
 These three things should match up to address your research questions.
