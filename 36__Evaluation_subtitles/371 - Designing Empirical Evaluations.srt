1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,475
 When we do qualitative evaluations,

2
00:00:02,475 --> 00:00:06,405
 we effectively just bring in participants one at a time or maybe in groups,

3
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:08,955
 go through a certain interview protocol or script,

4
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:10,740
 and then move them along.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,680
 Empirical evaluation is different though.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,564
 Here, we have multiple conditions which we call treatments.

7
00:00:17,564 --> 00:00:19,979
 These treatments could be different interfaces,

8
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:21,630
 different designs, different colors,

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,775
 whatever we're interested in investigating.

10
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:26,940
 Our goal here is to investigate the comparison between

11
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,270
 the treatments and end up with a conclusion about how they are different.

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,050
 However, we have to be careful to make sure that the differences that we observe

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,265
 really are due to differences between the treatments and not due to other factors.

14
00:00:38,265 --> 00:00:41,824
 For example, imagine we're testing the difference between two logos,

15
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:45,020
 and we want to know what works better, orange or teal.

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,230
 However, we also make one a circle and the other one a triangle.

17
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,745
 In the end, we wouldn't be able to comment on orange versus teal.

18
00:00:51,745 --> 00:00:55,445
 We can only comment on orange circle versus teal triangle.

19
00:00:55,445 --> 00:00:57,005
 To make a judgement about the color,

20
00:00:57,005 --> 00:01:00,275
 we need to make sure that the color is the only thing that we're comparing.

21
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:03,200
 Of course, this example right here sound a little bit silly.

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,915
 In practice though, differences can be more subtle.

23
00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:07,940
 If you're testing between different layouts,

24
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,810
 you might missed that one loads a bit faster or that one uses prettier images,

25
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,675
 and that could actually account for any differences that you observe.

26
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,370
 Once we've designed the treatments,

27
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,695
 it's time to design the experiment itself.

28
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:20,080
 Our first question is,

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,760
 what do the participants do?

30
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,100
 Does each participant participate in one treatment or both?

31
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,370
 If each participant only participates in one treatment,

32
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,990
 then our next step is pretty easy.

33
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,585
 We split the participants randomly into two groups,

34
00:01:32,585 --> 00:01:35,080
 and one by one, they each go through their treatment.

35
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,070
 At the end, we have the data from participants in

36
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,875
 one group to comparative data from participants in the other group.

37
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,795
 This is a between subjects design,

38
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:44,495
 we're comparing the data from one group to the other group.

39
00:01:44,495 --> 00:01:45,950
 There's a second option though,

40
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,710
 we can also do a within subjects experiment.

41
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,405
 With a within subjects experiment,

42
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:53,600
 each participant experiences both treatments.

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,720
 However, a major lurking variable could potentially be,

44
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,370
 which treatment each participant sees first?

45
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,630
 So, we still have to randomly assign participants to treatment groups.

46
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,795
 But instead of assigning participants to which treatment they are receiving,

47
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:09,575
 we're randomly assigning them to what order they'll receive the treatments in.

48
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:13,030
 That way, if the order of the participants received the treatments in matters,

49
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,270
 we'll see it in our data.

50
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,970
 Within subject is beneficial because it allows us to gather

51
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,670
 twice as much data if our participant pool is limited.

52
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,915
 Here, each interface would be used by 16 participants instead of just eight.

53
00:02:23,915 --> 00:02:26,630
 It also allows us to do within subjects comparison,

54
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,910
 seeing how each individual participant was affected,

55
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,340
 instead of the groups as a whole.

56
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,720
 That can help us identify some more subtle effects,

57
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,660
 like, if different people have different strengths.

58
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,910
 However, within subjects requires more of our subjects time,

59
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,165
 which can be a big problem if the treatments are themselves pretty long.

60
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:44,645
 Throughout this example, we've also glossed over important detail.

61
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:46,175
 Random assignment.

62
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:49,475
 Random assignment to treatment helps us control for other biases.

63
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:52,145
 Imagine if all the smartest participants or all the women

64
00:02:52,145 --> 00:02:54,995
 were all placed in one group and all receive the same treatment,

65
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:57,245
 that would clearly affect our results.

66
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:59,600
 That's why we randomly assign people to groups.

67
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,370
 Now, that might sound obvious,

68
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,210
 but imagine if you're treatment involves a physical setup,

69
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,650
 it would be tempting to run the first eight participants on

70
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,220
 one setup and a second eight participants on the other,

71
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,180
 so you don't have to switch back and forth between them.

72
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,275
 But what if that means that

73
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,040
 all the more punctual participants were in the first condition,

74
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,530
 or what if you got better at administering the experiment during the first condition?

75
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,010
 So that participants in the second condition had a generally smoother experience.

76
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,680
 All of these looking variables are controlled in part,

77
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:24,680
 by random assignment to groups.
