00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,075
 Predictive evaluation is evaluation we can do without actual users.

2
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:08,990
 Now, in user centered design that's not ideal, but predictive evaluation can be

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,270
 more efficient and accessible than actual user evaluation.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,510
 So it's all right to use it as part of a rapid feedback process.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,430
 It lets keep the user in mind,

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,470
 even we we're not bringing users into the conversation.

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,820
 The important thing is to make sure we're using it appropriately.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,980
 Predictive evaluation shouldn't be used where we could be doing qualitative or

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,640
 empirical evaluation.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,520
 It should only be used where we wouldn't otherwise be doing any evaluation.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:32,520
 Effectively, it's better than nothing.
