1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,430
 With qualitative research,

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:04,210
 we want to capture as much of the session as possible.

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,950
 Because things could come up that we don't anticipate.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,680
 And we'd like to look at them again later.

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,960
 So how do we do that?

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,360
 One way is to actually record the session.

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,965
 The pros of recording a session are that it's automated, it's comprehensive, and

8
00:00:15,965 --> 00:00:17,155
 it's passive.

9
00:00:17,155 --> 00:00:19,545
 Automated means that it runs automatically in the background.

10
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:22,145
 Comprehensive means that it captures everything that happens

11
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:23,085
 during the session.

12
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:26,755
 And passive means that it lets us focus on administering the session

13
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:28,305
 instead of capturing it.

14
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:29,225
 The cons though,

15
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:33,235
 are that it's intrusive, it's difficult to analyze, and it's screenless.

16
00:00:33,235 --> 00:00:37,500
 Intrusive means that many participants are uncomfortable being videotaped.

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,590
 It creates oppression knowing that every question or

18
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,930
 every mistake is going to captured and analyzed by researchers later.

19
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,440
 Video is also very difficult to analyze.

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,450
 It requires a person to come later and

21
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,930
 watch every minute of video, usually several times, in order to code and

22
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,410
 pull out what was actually relevant in that session.

23
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,330
 And video recording often has difficulty capturing interactions on-screen.

24
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,930
 We can film what a person is doing on a keyboard or with a mouse, but

25
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,460
 it is difficult to then see how that translates to on-screen actions.

26
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,400
 Now some of these issues can be resolved, of course.

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,935
 We can do video capture on the screen synchronize it with a video recording.

28
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,785
 But if we're dealing with children, or at risk populations, or

29
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:16,435
 with some delicate subject matter, the intrusiveness can be overwhelming.

30
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:18,655
 And if we want to do a lot of complex sessions,

31
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:21,965
 the difficulty in analyzing that data can also be overwhelming.

32
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:24,815
 For my dissertation work I captured about 200 hours of video, and

33
00:01:24,815 --> 00:01:27,600
 that's probably why it took me an extra year to graduate.

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,990
 It takes a lot of time to go through all that video.

35
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,000
 So instead we can also focus on note-taking.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,318
 The benefits of note-taking are that it's very cheap, it's not intrusive, and

37
00:01:37,318 --> 00:01:38,314
 it is analyzable.

38
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:41,403
 It's cheap because we don't have to buy expensive cameras or equipment,

39
00:01:41,403 --> 00:01:44,355
 we just have our pens and papers or our laptops, or anything like that.

40
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:47,191
 And can just do it using equipment we already have available to us.

41
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:51,210
 It's not intrusive, in that it only captures what we decide to capture.

42
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,460
 If a participant is uncomfortable asking questions or makes a silly mistake with

43
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,690
 the interface, we don't necessarily have to capture that, and that can make

44
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,925
 the participant feel a little bit more comfortable being themselves.

45
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:03,455
 And it's a lot easier to analyze notes.

46
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:04,275
 You can scroll through and

47
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:06,815
 read the notes on a one hour session in only a few minutes.

48
00:02:06,815 --> 00:02:09,685
 But analyzing that same session in video is certainly going to take at

49
00:02:09,685 --> 00:02:12,515
 least an hour, if not more, to watch it more than once.

50
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:14,122
 But but of course there are draw backs too.

51
00:02:14,122 --> 00:02:16,732
 Taking those can be a very slow process, meaning that we

52
00:02:16,732 --> 00:02:19,612
 can't keep up with the dynamic interactions that we're evaluating.

53
00:02:19,612 --> 00:02:22,482
 It's also manual which means that we actually have to focus on

54
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:25,832
 actively taking notes, which gets in the way of administering the session.

55
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:27,103
 If you're going to use note taking,

56
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:29,281
 you probably want to actually have two people involved.

57
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:32,511
 One person running the session, and one person taking notes.

58
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:34,981
 And finally, it's limited in what it captures.

59
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:36,561
 It might not capture some of the movements or

60
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:39,700
 the motions that a person does when interacting with an interface.

61
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,960
 It doesn't capture how long they hesitate before deciding

62
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,270
 what to do next.

63
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,070
 We can write all that down of course, but

64
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,490
 we're going to run into the limitation of how fast we can take notes.

65
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,460
 It would be nearly impossible to simultaneously take notes on what

66
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,630
 questions the user is asking, how long they're taking to do things, and

67
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,930
 what kind of mistakes they're making.

68
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,210
 Especially if we're also responsible for administering the session at the same.

69
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,920
 A third approach if we're designing software,

70
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,030
 is to actually log the behavior inside the software.

71
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,920
 This is in some ways, the best of both worlds.

72
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,340
 Like video capture, it's automatic and passive, but

73
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,400
 like note taking, it's analyzable.

74
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,700
 Because it's run to the system itself, it automatically captures everything

75
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,000
 that it knows how to capture, and it does so without our active invention.

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,780
 But it likely does so in a data or

77
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,230
 text format, that we can then either analyze manually by reading through it,

78
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,580
 or even with some more complicated data analytics methods.

79
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,860
 So in some ways, it captures the pros from both note-taking and video capture.

80
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,690
 But it also has its drawbacks as well.

81
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,820
 Especially, it's very limited.

82
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,550
 We can only capture those things that are actually expressed

83
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,850
 inside the software.

84
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,730
 Things like the questions that a participant asks wouldn't naturally be

85
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,390
 captured by software logging.

86
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,820
 Similarly, it only captures a narrow slice of the interaction.

87
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,730
 It only captures what the user actually does on the screen.

88
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,100
 It doesn't capture how long they look at something.

89
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,620
 We might be able to infer that by looking at the time between

90
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,860
 interactions, but it's difficult to know if that hesitation was because they

91
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,310
 couldn't decide what to do, or

92
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,450
 because someone was making noise outside, or something else was going on.

93
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,610
 And finally, it's also very tech sensitive.

94
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,830
 We really have to have a working prototype,

95
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,530
 in order to use software logging.

96
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,420
 But remember, many of our prototypes dont' work yet.

97
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,730
 You can't do software logging on a paper prototype, or a card prototype, or

98
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,180
 a Wizard of Oz prototype.

99
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,380
 This only really works once we've reached a certain level of fidelity with

100
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,600
 our interfaces.

101
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,630
 So in selecting a way to capture your qualitative evaluation,

102
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,450
 ask yourself, will the subjects find being captured on camera intrusive?

103
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,690
 Do I need to capture what happens on screen?

104
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,120
 How difficult will this data be to analyze?

105
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,260
 It's tempting, especially for

106
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,410
 novices, to focus on just capturing as much as possible during the session.

107
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,260
 But during the session is when you can capture data in a way that's going to

108
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,050
 make your analysis easier.

109
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,070
 So think about the analysis that you want to do,

110
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,070
 when deciding how to capture your sessions.
