2
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:08,679
 The heart of user-centered design is getting

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:10,744
 frequent feedback from the users.

4
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,720
 That's where evaluation comes into play.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,140
 Evaluation is where we take what we've designed and

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,940
 put it in front of users to get their feedback.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,850
 But just as different prototypes serve different functions at different stages

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,620
 of the design process, so also our methods for

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,000
 evaluation need to match as well.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,910
 Early on, we want more qualitative feedback.

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,640
 We want to know what they like, what they don't like, whether it's readable,

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,450
 whether it's understandable.

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,630
 Later on, we want to know if it's usable.

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,310
 Does it actually minimize your workload?

15
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,030
 Is it intuitive?

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,810
 Is it easy to learn?

17
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,470
 Then at the end, we might want to know something more quantitative.

18
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,180
 We might want to actually measure, for example, whether the time to complete

19
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,150
 a task has changed, or whether the number of sales has increased.

20
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,070
 Along the way, we might also want to iterate even more quickly

21
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,890
 by predicting what the results of user evaluation will be.

22
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,810
 The type of evaluation we employ is tightly related to

23
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,100
 where we are in our design process.

24
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,300
 So in this lesson, we'll discuss the different methods for

25
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:05,300
 performing evaluation to get the feedback we need when we need it.
