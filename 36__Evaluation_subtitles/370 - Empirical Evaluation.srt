1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
 In an empirical evaluation,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,005
 we're trying to evaluate something formal,

3
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,360
 and most often that means something numeric.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,900
 It could be something explicitly numeric like what layout of buttons

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,455
 leads to more purchases or what gestures are most efficient to use.

6
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:16,050
 There could also be some interpretation involved though like

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,245
 counting errors or summarizing survey responses.

8
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:23,880
 The overall goal though is to come to the something verifiable and conclusive.

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,755
 In industry, this is often useful in comparing designs or in demonstrating improvement.

10
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:31,050
 In research though, this is even more important,

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,700
 because this is how we build

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,090
 new theories of how people think when they're using interfaces.

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,890
 If we wanted to prove, for example,

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,685
 that gestural interaction has a tougher learning curve than voice interaction,

15
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:45,349
 or that an audio interface is just as usable as a visual one,

16
00:00:45,349 --> 00:00:48,380
 we would need to do empirical evaluation between the interfaces.

17
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,255
 Now, most empirical evaluations are going to be comparisons.

18
00:00:52,255 --> 00:00:55,475
 We can do quantitative analysis without doing comparisons,

19
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:57,515
 but it usually isn't necessary.

20
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,990
 The biggest benefit of quantitative analysis is

21
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,275
 the ability to help us perform objective comparisons.

22
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:05,060
 So, with empirical evaluation,

23
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,895
 our overall question is usually,

24
00:01:06,895 --> 00:01:06,895
 how can we show that there is a difference between these designs?
