00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
 The most common type of predictive evaluation you'll

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,834
 encounter is most likely the cognitive walkthrough.

3
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:07,170
 In a cognitive walkthrough,

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,750
 we stepped through the process of interacting with an interface,

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,745
 mentally simulating in each stage what the user is seeing and thinking and doing.

6
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:16,740
 To do this, we start by constructing

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,950
 specific tasks that can be completed within our prototype.

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,535
 So I'm going to try this with the card prototype that I used with Morgan earlier.

9
00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:25,190
 I start with some goal in mind.

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,470
 So right now, my goal might be to leave a note while listening.

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,030
 I look at the interface and I try to imagine myself as a novice user.

12
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,605
 Will they know what to do?

13
00:00:33,605 --> 00:00:36,300
 Well, here's a button that says View and Take Notes,

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,320
 and if they want to take a note,

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,950
 I think that's reasonable to assume that they would know to do that.

16
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,295
 So I tap that button and what response do I get?

17
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:45,650
 Well, that's when this screen will come up.

18
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,685
 The system will pause playback first and then it will show me the note-taking screen,

19
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:51,890
 and I go through the entire system like this,

20
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,450
 predicting what actions the user will

21
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,590
 take and noting the response of the system will give.

22
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,420
 At every stage of the process,

23
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,140
 I want to investigate this from the perspective of the gulfs of execution and evaluation.

24
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,545
 Is it reasonable to expect the user to cross that gulf of execution?

25
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:09,125
 Is the right action sufficiently obvious?

26
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,640
 Is a response to the action,

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,130
 the one the user would expect?

28
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,240
 Now on the other side, is it reasonable to

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,825
 expect the feedback to cross the gulf of evaluation?

30
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:19,120
 Does the feedback show the user what happened?

31
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,420
 Does the feedback confirm the user chose the right action?

32
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,770
 Now, the weakness of cognitive walkthroughs is that we're the designers,

33
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,500
 so it likely seems to us like the design is just fine.

34
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,490
 After all, that's why we designed it that way.

35
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,960
 But if you can sufficiently put yourself in the user's shoes,

36
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,225
 you can start to uncover some really useful takeaways.

37
00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:38,755
 So, here for example,

38
00:01:38,755 --> 00:01:40,525
 from this cognitive walkthrough,

39
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:42,550
 I've noticed that there isn't sufficient feedback

40
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,500
 when the user has finished leaving a note.

41
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,540
 The system just stops recording and resumes

42
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,960
 playback which doesn't confirm that the note is received,

43
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,550
 and right now that might be a minor issue since there's implicit feedback.

44
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,215
 The only way that playback resumes is if the note is received,

45
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:59,710
 but I'm also now realizing that it's quite likely that

46
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,500
 users might start to leave notes and then decide to cancel them,

47
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,660
 so they both need a cancel option,

48
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,305
 and they need feedback to indicate whether the note was completed and saved or canceled.

49
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:13,940
 I got all that feedback just out of this cognitive walkthrough of the interface as is.

50
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,895
 So if you can put yourself in the novice's shoes well enough,

51
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:16,895
 you can find some really good feedback without the difficulties of involving real users.
