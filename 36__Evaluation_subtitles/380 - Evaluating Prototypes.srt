00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,545
 When we discussed the prototypes for our design for an audio book tool for exercisers,

2
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:08,445
 we briefly showed the evaluation stage with Morgan actually using them.

3
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:10,935
 Let's look at that in a little bit more depth though.

4
00:00:10,935 --> 00:00:12,570
 What were we evaluating?

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,100
 At any stage of the process,

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,800
 we could have been performing qualitative evaluation.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,590
 We asked Morgan how easy or hard things were to do,

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,240
 how much he enjoyed using the interface,

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,140
 and what her thought process was in interacting with certain prototypes.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,350
 We could have also performed some quantitative analyses.

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,200
 When she used the card-based prototype for example,

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,230
 we could have measured the amount of time it took her to decide what to do,

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,505
 or counted the number of errors she committed.

14
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:39,490
 We could do the same kind of thing with the Wizard of Oz Prototype as well.

15
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,340
 We could call to Morgan commands like press play and place a bookmark,

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,620
 and see how long it takes her to execute the commands,

17
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,235
 or how many errors she commits along the way.

18
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:50,960
 Between opportunities to work with Morgan though,

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,179
 we might also use some predictive evaluation

20
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:55,790
 to ensure that we keep her in mind while we're designing.

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,620
 Our goal is to apply

22
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,835
 multiple evaluation techniques to constantly center our designs around the user.

23
00:01:01,835 --> 00:01:05,855
 That's why evaluation is a foundation of user-centered design.

24
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:09,830
 Just like we wanted to understand the user and the task before beginning to design,

25
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,110
 we also want to understand how the user relates to

26
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:12,110
 the design at every iteration of the design life-cycle.
