1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,770
 When we discussed prototyping, we talked about how over time

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,100
 the nature of our prototypes get higher and higher fidelity.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,430
 Something similar happens with evaluation.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,510
 Over time, the evaluation method we'll use will change.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,520
 Throughout most of our design process our evaluations are formative.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,030
 Meaning their primary purpose is to help us redesign and improve our interface.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,880
 At the end, though, we might want to do something more summative to

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,560
 conclude the design process,

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,420
 especially if we want to demonstrate that the new interface is better.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,960
 Formative evaluation is evaluation with the intention of

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,090
 improving the interface going forward.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,510
 Summative is with the intention of conclusively saying at the end

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,250
 what the difference was.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,810
 In reality, hopefully we never do summative evaluation.

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,370
 Hopefully our evaluations are always with the purpose

16
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,980
 of revising our interface and making it better over time.

17
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,310
 But in practice, there might come times when you need to demonstrate a very

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,760
 clear quantitative difference.

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,370
 And because of this difference,

20
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,130
 our early evaluations tend to be more qualitative.

21
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,129
 Qualitative evaluations tend to be more interpretative and informal.

22
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,243
 Their goal is to help us improve or understand the task.

23
00:01:07,243 --> 00:01:11,710
 Our later evaluations are likely more empirical, controlled, and formal.

24
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,820
 Their goal is to demonstrate or assess change.

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,470
 So while formative evaluation and summative evaluation were

26
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,700
 the purposes of our evaluations, qualitative evaluations and

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,140
 empirical evaluations are ways to actually fulfill those purposes.

28
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,260
 Predictive evaluation is a little outside the spectrum,

29
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,780
 so we'll talk about that as well.

30
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,029
 As far as this is concerned,

31
00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:33,470
 predictive evaluations tend to be very similar to qualitative evaluations.

32
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,450
 They inform how we revise and improve our interfaces over time.

33
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,410
 These three categories actually form the bulk of what we'll talk about

34
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,940
 in this lesson.

35
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,990
 Recall also that earlier we talked about the difference between qualitative and

36
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,370
 quantitative data.

37
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,560
 As you've probably realized,

38
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,210
 if qualitative evaluation occurs early, an empirical evaluation occurs late.

39
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,970
 And chances are, we're using qualitative data more early, and

40
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,730
 quantitative data more late.

41
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:01,050
 In reality, qualitative data is really always useful to improve our interfaces,

42
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,370
 whereas quantitative data, while always useful,

43
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,760
 really can only arise when we have pretty rigorous evaluations.

44
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,910
 And then one last area we can look at is where the evaluation takes place.

45
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,995
 In a controlled lab setting or actually out in the field.

46
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:16,685
 Generally when we're testing our early low fidelity interfaces,

47
00:02:16,685 --> 00:02:20,055
 we probably want to do it in a lab setting as opposed to out in the wild.

48
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:22,635
 We want to bring participants into our lab and actually describe what we're

49
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:26,607
 going for, the rationale behind certain decisions, and get their feedback.

50
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:29,890
 Later on we might want to do real field testing where we give users a somewhat

51
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,927
 working prototype, or something resembling a working prototype.

52
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:35,770
 And they can actually reflect on it as they go about their regular lives,

53
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,407
 participating in whatever task that interface is supposed to help with.

54
00:02:39,407 --> 00:02:42,547
 This helps us focus exclusively on the interface early on, and

55
00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:45,800
 in transition to focusing on the interface in context later.

56
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,210
 But of course we want to also think about the context early on.

57
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,242
 We could for example, develop a very navigation app that works great when we

58
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:56,649
 test in our lab, because it demands a very high cognitive load.

59
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:59,866
 But doesn't work at all out in the field because when participants are actually

60
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:03,170
 driving, they can't spare that cognitive load to focus on our app.

61
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,270
 Now of course none of these are hard and fast rules.

62
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,110
 We'll very likely often do qualitative evaluation late or

63
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,930
 maybe do some field testing early.

64
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,900
 But as general principles, this is probably the order in which we want to

65
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:12,900
 think about our different evaluation styles.
