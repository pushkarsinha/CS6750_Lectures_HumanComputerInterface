1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,620
 There are a lot of ways to evaluate interfaces.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,280
 So to organize our discussion of evaluation,

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,840
 I've broken these into three categories.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,520
 The first is qualitative evaluation.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,520
 This is where we want to get qualitative feedback from users.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,120
 What do they like, what do they dislike, what's easy, what's hard.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,210
 We'll get that information through some methods very similar, in fact identical,

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,430
 to our methods for need finding.

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,900
 The second is empirical evaluation.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,864
 This is where we actually want to do some controlled experiments and

11
00:00:27,864 --> 00:00:30,360
 evaluate the results quantitatively.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,630
 For that, we need many more participants, and

13
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,040
 we also want to make sure we addressed the big qualitative feedback first.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,800
 The third is predictive evaluation.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,740
 Predictive evaluation is specifically evaluation without users.

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,080
 In user centered design,

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,610
 this is obviously not our favorite kind of evaluation.

18
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,840
 Evaluation with real users though is oftentimes slow and

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,220
 its really expensive.

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,000
 So it's useful for

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,350
 us to have ways we can do some simple evaluation on a day to day basis.

22
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,270
 So we'll structure our discussion of evaluation around these three general

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:00,270
 categories.
