00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,485
 One of the biggest trends of the information age is the incredible availability of data.

2
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:06,780
 Scientists and researchers use data science and

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,525
 machine learning to look at lots of data and draw conclusions.

4
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:12,150
 But often times, these conclusions are only useful if we

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,775
 can turn around and communicate them to ordinary people.

6
00:00:14,775 --> 00:00:17,130
 That's where Information Visualization comes in.

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,630
 Now, at first glance you might not think of data visualization as an example of HCI.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,060
 After all, I could draw data visualization on a napkin,

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,110
 and print in a newspaper,

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,930
 and there's no computer involved anywhere in that process.

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,665
 But computers give us a powerful way to re-represent data in complex,

12
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,540
 animated, and interactive ways.

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,020
 We'll put links to some excellent examples in the notes.

14
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,749
 Now, what's particularly notable about data visualization in HCI,

15
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:41,310
 is the degree with which it fits

16
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,525
 perfectly with our methodologies for designing good interfaces.

17
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:46,520
 One goal of a good interface is to match

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,760
 the user's mental model to the reality of the task at hand in

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,670
 the same way the goal of information visualization is to match

20
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,920
 the reader's mental model of the phenomenon to the reality of it.

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,120
 So, the same principles we discussed for designing good representations,

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,775
 apply directly to designing good visualizations.

23
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:01,775
 After all, a visualization is just a representation of data.
