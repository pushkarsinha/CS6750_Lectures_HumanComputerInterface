1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,905
 What time is it?

2
00:00:01,905 --> 00:00:03,945
 You can go ahead and go to lunch.

3
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:05,805
 Did that exchange make any sense?

4
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:09,885
 I asked Amanda for the time and she replied by saying I can go ahead and go get lunch.

5
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:13,920
 The text seems completely nonsensical and yet hearing that,

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,145
 you may have filled in the context that makes this conversation logical.

7
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:19,680
 You might think that I asked a while ago what time we were breaking for

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,350
 lunch or maybe I mentioned that I forgot to eat breakfast.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,660
 Amanda would have that context and she'd use it to

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,270
 understand why I'm probably asking for the time.

11
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,275
 Context is a fundamental part of the way humans interact with other humans.

12
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:33,570
 Some lessons we'll talk about even suggests that we are

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,495
 completely incapable of interacting without context.

14
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:39,945
 If context is such a pervasive part of the way humans communicate,

15
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:42,770
 then to build good interfaces between humans and computers,

16
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,775
 we must equip computers with some understanding of context.

17
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:48,275
 That's where context-sensitive computing comes in.

18
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:51,260
 Context-sensitive computing attempts to give computer interfaces

19
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,620
 the contextual knowledge that humans have in their everyday lives.

20
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,900
 For example, I use my mobile phone differently

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,550
 depending on whether I'm sitting on the couch at home,

22
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,620
 or using it in my car,

23
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,360
 or walking around on the sidewalk.

24
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,380
 Imagine I didn't have to deliberately inform my phone of what mode I was in though.

25
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,660
 Imagine if it just detected that I was in my car and

26
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,210
 automatically brought up Google Maps and audible for me.

27
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,190
 Services have started to emerge to

28
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,470
 provide this but there's an enormous amount of research to be

29
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,580
 done on context-sensitive computing especially as it relates to things like wearables,

30
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:19,580
 augmented reality, and ubiquitous computing.
