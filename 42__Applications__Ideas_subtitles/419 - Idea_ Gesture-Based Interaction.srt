1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
 As this course goes, on you'll find that I'm on camera more

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,270
 often than you might be accustomed to seeing any udacity course.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,300
 Around half this course actually takes place with me on camera,

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,985
 there are a couple of reasons for that.

5
00:00:10,985 --> 00:00:13,950
 The big one is that this is human-computer interaction,

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,295
 so it makes sense to put a strong emphasis on the human.

7
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:20,340
 But another big one is that when I'm on camera I can express myself

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,279
 through gestures instead of just through words and voice intonations.

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,750
 I can, for example, make a fist and really drive home and emphasize a point.

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,340
 I can explain that a topic applies to

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,210
 a very narrow portion of the field or a very wide portion of the field.

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,350
 We communicate naturally with gestures every day.

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,850
 In fact, we even have an entire language built out of gestures.

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,500
 So, wouldn't it be great if our computers can interpret our gestures as well?

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,275
 That's the emerging field of gesture-based interaction.

16
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:47,480
 You've seen this with things like the Microsoft Kinect which

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,510
 has far-ranging applications from health care to gaming.

18
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,510
 We've started to see some applications of gesture-based interaction on the go

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,845
 as well with wristbands that react to certain hand motions.

20
00:00:56,845 --> 00:00:59,595
 Gesture-based interaction has enormous potential.

21
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:01,610
 The fingers have some of the finest muscle movements,

22
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,050
 meaning that a system based on

23
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,340
 finger movements could support an incredible number of interactions.

24
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,040
 We might see a day when it's possible to type invisibly in the air in front

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,790
 of you based on the system's recognition to the movement of the muscles in your wrist.

26
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:13,790
 That might finally allow mobile devices to despise traditional computers altogether.
