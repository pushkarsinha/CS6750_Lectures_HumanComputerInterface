00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,220
 I always find it interesting how certain technologies seem to come

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,830
 around full circle.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,660
 For centuries we only interacted directly with the things that we built

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,660
 and then computers came along.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,910
 And suddenly we needed interfaces between us and our tasks.

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,733
 Now, computers are trying to actively capture natural ways we've always

7
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:16,920
 interacted.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,800
 Almost every computer I encounter now days has a touch screen.

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,980
 That's a powerful technique for creating simple user interfaces because it

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,170
 shortens the distance between the user and

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,290
 the tasks theyâ€™re trying to accomplish.

12
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,160
 Think about someone using a mouse for the first time.

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,750
 He might need to look back and forth from the screen to the mouse,

14
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,640
 to see how interacting down here, change things he sees up here.

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,040
 With a touch based interface,

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,490
 he interacts the same way he uses things in the real world around him.

17
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,380
 A challenge can sometimes be a lack of precision, but to make up for

18
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,930
 that we've also create pen based interaction.

19
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,600
 Just like a person can use a pen on paper,

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,860
 they can also use a pen on a touch screen.

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,460
 And in fact, you might be quite familiar with that,

22
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,530
 because most Udacity courses use exactly that technology.

23
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,780
 They record someone writing on a screen.

24
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,610
 That gives us the precision necessary to interact very delicately and

25
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,280
 specifically with our task.

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,510
 And as a result tablet based interaction methods have been used in fields like

27
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,760
 art and music.

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,870
 Most comics you find on the internet are actually drawn exactly like this,

29
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,870
 combining the precision of human fingers with the power of computation.
