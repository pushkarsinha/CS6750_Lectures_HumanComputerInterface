00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,650
 There may be no better example of the power of direct manipulation than

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,790
 watching a baby use an interface.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,640
 Let's watch my daughter, Lucy, try and use her Kindle Fire tablet.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,122
 My daughter Lucy is 18 months old, yet when I give her an interface that uses

5
00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:14,224
 direct manipulation, she's able to use it.

6
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:17,762
 She wouldn't be able to use a keyboard or a mouse yet, but because she's

7
00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:21,130
 directly interacting with the things on the screen, she can use it.

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,863
 Actually, there might be an even better example of direct manipulation in

9
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:26,470
 action.

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,400
 There are games made for tablet computers for cats.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:29,400
 Yes, cats can use tablet computers when they use direct manipulation.
