1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,340
 We shouldn't fall into the trap of assuming that just because an interface

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,140
 has become invisible, the design is great.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,980
 Interfaces become invisible not just through great design, but

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,290
 also because users learn to use them.

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,610
 With enough practice and experience,

6
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,790
 many users will become sufficiently comfortable with many interfaces

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,910
 to feel invisibly integrated in the task.

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,960
 So take driving for example.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,450
 Lets say I'm driving a car and I discover I'm headed right for someone.

10
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,720
 What's my reaction?

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,090
 Well I turn the wheel to the side and I press my brake.

12
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:28,690
 It's instinctive.

13
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,290
 I do it immediately, but think about that action.

14
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,580
 If I was just running down the street and

15
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,530
 suddenly I saw someone in front of me would it be natural for

16
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,320
 me to go like that?

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,110
 Of course not.

18
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,140
 The steering wheel was an interface I used to turn to the left.

19
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,030
 But it's become invisible during the task of driving because of all my

20
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,360
 practice with it.

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,150
 But just because the interface has become invisible doesn't mean it's great

22
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,210
 interface.

23
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,665
 People spend months learning to drive,

24
00:00:50,665 --> 00:00:52,212
 they pay hundreds of dollars for classes.

25
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:53,750
 And they have to pass a complicated test.

26
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,160
 Driving is important enough that it can have that kind of learning curve.

27
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,040
 But for the interfaces that we design, we generally can't expect users to

28
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,650
 give us an entire year just to learn to use them.

29
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,480
 We'll be lucky if they give us an entire minute to learn to use them.

30
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:05,480
 So our goal is to make our interfaces invisible by design.
