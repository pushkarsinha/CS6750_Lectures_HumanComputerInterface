00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,910
 For this design challenge, let's tackle one of the most common problems

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,810
 addressed in undergraduate HCI classes, designing a better remote control.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,760
 Now, these probably aren't very good interfaces.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,060
 And that's not to say that they're poorly designed, but

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,470
 the constraints on how many different things they have to do and

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,420
 how limiting the physical structure can be, make these difficult to use.

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,960
 You might have seen humorous images online of people putting

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,790
 tape over certain buttons on the controls to make them easier to use for

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,750
 their parents or their kids.

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,380
 How would we design an invisible interface for universal remote control,

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:30,380
 one that doesn't have the learning curves that these have?
