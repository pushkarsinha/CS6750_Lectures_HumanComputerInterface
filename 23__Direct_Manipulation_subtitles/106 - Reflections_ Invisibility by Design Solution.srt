00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,780
 One of my favorite examples of an interface that is invisible by design

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,310
 comes from a video game called Portal 2.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,550
 In lots of video games, you use a control stick to control the camera in

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,960
 game, but different people have different preferences for

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,630
 how the camera should behave.

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,950
 Some feel if you press up, you should look up.

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,665
 Others like myself, feel if you press down you should look up,

8
00:00:18,665 --> 00:00:21,370
 more like you're controlling an airplane with a joystick.

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,060
 In most games you have to set this manually by going to options,

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,100
 selecting camera controls, and enabling or

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,680
 disabling a y axis and it's just a chore.

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,768
 But in portal two, watch what happens.

13
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,630
 >> You will here a buzzer.

14
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,637
 When you hear the buzzer, look up at the ceiling.

15
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,343
 [SOUND] Good.

16
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:40,810
 You will hear a buzzer.

17
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,045
 When you hear the buzzer, look down at the floor.

18
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:45,977
 [SOUND] Good.

19
00:00:45,977 --> 00:00:49,063
 This completes the gymnastic portion of your mandatory physical and

20
00:00:49,063 --> 00:00:51,660
 mental wellness exercise.

21
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,960
 >> Did you see that?

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,400
 It was so subtle you might not have even noticed it.

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,130
 A character in the game asked me to look up.

24
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,360
 The game assumed whichever direction I pressed

25
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,850
 was the way I would want to press when I want to look up.

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,750
 And set my preference accordingly.

27
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,050
 No option screen, no changing settings.

28
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,230
 The game automatically and

29
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,230
 invisibly had me complete my goal of correctly setting my camera preference.
