1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,480
 Whether through using direct manipulation,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,850
 through innovative approaches to shrinking these gulfs or

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,270
 through the user's patience and learning, our ultimate goal is for

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,730
 the interface between the user and the task to become invisible.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,070
 What this means is that even though there is an interface in the middle,

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,460
 the user spends no time thinking about it.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,660
 Instead, they feel like they're interacting directly with the task

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,600
 rather than with some interface.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:32,800
 So for example, I have a stylus and I'm going to write on this tablet computer.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,210
 I'm interacting with an interface just translating my drawing

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,480
 into data in the system.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,922
 But for me, this feels just like I'm writing on a normal page.

13
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:48,050
 That feels just like writing on paper.

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,880
 This interface between me and

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,410
 the data representation of my drawing underneath is pretty much invisible.

16
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,710
 I feel like I'm writing on paper.

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:06,603
 Contrast that with trying to draw with a mouse.

18
00:01:06,603 --> 00:01:09,060
 That feels extremely unnatural.

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,524
 I'm very well aware of the mouse as the interface between myself and

20
00:01:12,524 --> 00:01:13,568
 this drawing task.

21
00:01:13,568 --> 00:01:17,728
 So the direct manipulation facilitated by the stylus gets me much closer to my

22
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:20,608
 task and helps the interface disappear between me and

23
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:20,608
 what I'm trying to accomplish.
