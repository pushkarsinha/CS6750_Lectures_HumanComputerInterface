00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,540
 Take a moment real quick and

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,410
 reflect on some of the tasks you perform with computers day-to-day.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,370
 What are some of the places where you don't interact through

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,780
 direct manipulation?

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,670
 If you're having trouble thinking of one, think especially about places where

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,910
 technology is replacing things you used to do manually.

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:15,440
 Chances are,

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,210
 the physical interface was a bit closer to the task than the new technical one.

9
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:19,210
 How can the technical interface better leverage direct manipulation?
