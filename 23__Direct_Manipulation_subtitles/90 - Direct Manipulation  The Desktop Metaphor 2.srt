1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,430
 Files and folders on my computer are meant to mimic files and

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,480
 folders on my physical desk.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,480
 So we ideally want the action of moving them around on my computer to

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,840
 mimic the action of moving them around on my physical desk.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,790
 But it wasn't always like this.

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,870
 Before graphical user interfaces were common,

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,440
 we moved files around using command line interfaces like this.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,267
 The folder structure is still the same on the operating system.

9
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:25,623
 But instead of visualizing it as folders and icons,

10
00:00:25,623 --> 00:00:29,010
 I'm interacting with a text-based command line.

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,080
 To view the files,

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,380
 I might need to type a command like ls, which I just have to remember.

13
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,820
 If I don't remember that command,

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,780
 I don't have much recourse to go find out what I'm supposed to be doing.

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,920
 To move a file, I need to type something like this.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,230
 I have to type the command, the file I want to move,

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,650
 and the folder I want to move it to.

18
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,830
 Again, if I forget the name of that command, or the order of the parameters

19
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,930
 to provide, there's not a whole lot I can to to recover from that.

20
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,460
 I need to run off to Google and

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,420
 find out what the correct order of the commands was.

22
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,330
 Which is actually what I did before filming this video because I don't

23
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,120
 actually use the terminal very often.

24
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,686
 Then when I execute that command,

25
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:09,307
 there's not a lot of feedback to let me know if it actually executed correctly.

26
00:01:09,307 --> 00:01:12,290
 I might need to change folders to find out.

27
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,190
 There I see the files present in that folder but I had to go and

28
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,290
 look manually.

29
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,800
 There's nothing really natural about this.

30
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,700
 Now don't get me wrong, once you know how to interact with this interface,

31
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,680
 it's very efficient to use.

32
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,560
 But when you're a novice at it, when you've never used it before, this is

33
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,420
 completely unlike the task of managing physical files on your real desk.

34
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,430
 Then, the computer mouse came along.

35
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,840
 And with it came the ability to move a mouse around the screen.

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,190
 Equipped with this, my action in moving files and

37
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,390
 folders becomes much more direct.

38
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,027
 I can actually just click the file I want to move and

39
00:01:46,027 --> 00:01:48,164
 drag it into the new folder.

40
00:01:48,164 --> 00:01:51,469
 I get instant feedback by the fact that the file disappeared as soon as I

41
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:52,317
 dragged it over.

42
00:01:52,317 --> 00:01:56,200
 And there was a sound effect that you may or may not have been able to hear.

43
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,260
 So now instead of typing in some cryptic command that I just have to be able

44
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,070
 remember, I can just click on the file I want to move, and

45
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,630
 physically drag it to the folder in which I want to have it.

46
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,550
 That's a very natural interaction, it mimics what I do on my physical desk.

47
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,690
 Moving the mouse around is a lot better than having to type in those commands,

48
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,740
 but the gulf of execution and evaluation are still present, especially for

49
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,900
 some novice users.

50
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,800
 There's still some interpretation that has to happen to understand that when I

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,450
 move my hand a little left on the mouse,

52
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,120
 the cursor on screen will move to the left as well.

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,210
 And while clicking feels kind of like grabbing,

54
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,120
 there's still some interpretation there.

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,220
 It's more direct than the command line, but there's still a gap.

56
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,660
 The modern touchscreens made direct manipulation more direct than ever.

57
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,730
 Let's say I want to put an icon into a folder on my screen.

58
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,820
 How do I do it?

59
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,840
 I hold down the icon, and I drag it to the screen.

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,590
 The fact that if I wanted to move something around my desk,

61
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,630
 I would have to hold it down,

62
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,200
 means that this is almost entirely direct manipulation.

63
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,400
 I don't need any prior knowledge to attempt to do what feels natural for

64
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,740
 moving that icon into that folder.

65
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,820
 That gives us a nice, general heuristic to keep in mind.

66
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,020
 How do we help the user interact most closely with the target of their task?

67
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,020
 How do we make it so they're manipulating it as directly as possible?
