 Today we'll talk about two applications of good feedback cycles.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,540
 Direct manipulation and invisible interfaces.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,410
 Direct manipulation is the principle that the user should feel as much as

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,190
 possible like they're directly controlling the object of their task.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,890
 So for example, if you're trying to enlarge an image on your phone,

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,670
 it might be better to be able to drag it with your fingers

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,820
 rather than tapping a button that says, zoom in.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,990
 That way you're really interacting directly with the photo.

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,090
 New technologies like touch screens are making it more and

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,420
 more possible to feel like we're directly manipulating something,

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,680
 even when there's an interface in the way.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,180
 At their best, the interface actually disappears,

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,690
 which is what we mean by an invisible interface.

15
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,620
 With an invisible interface the user has to spend no time

16
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,750
 thinking about the interface that they're using.

17
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:46,750
 All their time is dedicated to thinking about the task that they're performing.
