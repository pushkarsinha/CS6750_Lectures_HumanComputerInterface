00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,510
 Our goal is to narrow the gulf of execution and

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,240
 the gulf of evaluation as much as possible.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,990
 And arguably the ultimate form of this is something called direct manipulation.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,950
 Now today direct manipulation is a very common interaction style.

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,190
 But in the history of HCI it was a revolutionary new approach.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,730
 Now to understand direct manipulation, let's talk about the desktop metaphor.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,060
 The files and folders on your computer are meant to mimic physical files and

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,570
 folders on a desktop.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,080
 So, here are on my physical desktop, I have some files.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,580
 What do I do if I want to move them?

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,659
 Well, I pick them up and I move them.

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,515
 What do I do if I want to put them in a folder?

13
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:39,315
 I pick them up and put them in the folder.

14
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:40,905
 I'm physically moving the files from

15
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:43,345
 where they are to where I want them to be.

16
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:46,055
 If files and folders on a computer are meant to mimic files and

17
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:49,225
 folders on a physical desk, then shouldn't the act of moving them also

18
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:51,665
 mimic the real world action of moving them?

19
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:55,715
 Wouldn't it narrow the gulf execution to leverage that real world experience and

20
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:55,715
 that real world expectation?
