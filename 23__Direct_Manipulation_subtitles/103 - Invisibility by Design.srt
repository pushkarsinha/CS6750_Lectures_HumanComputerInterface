00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,440
 Our goal is to create interfaces that are invisible from the moment the user

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,350
 starts using them.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,230
 They should feel immediately as if they're interacting with the task

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,080
 underlying the interface.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,910
 Now this is an extremely tall order and

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,740
 one we honestly probably won't meet very often, but it's the goal.

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,100
 In fact, in my opinion,

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,440
 this is why people tend to underestimate the complexity of HCI.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,610
 When you do things right,

10
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,100
 people won't be aware that you've done anything at all.

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,100
 So how do we create interfaces that are invisible from the very first moment

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,680
 the user starts using them?

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,450
 That's precisely what we'll discuss in a lot of our conversations about HCI.

14
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,620
 We'll talk about principles for creating interfaces that disappear like

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,195
 leveraging prior expectations and providing quick feedback.

16
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:40,130
 We'll also talk a lot about how to get inside the user's head and

17
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,860
 understand what they're seeing when they look at an interface that we can make

18
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,540
 sure that they're internal mental model matches the system.

19
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,420
 In fact, if we consider invisibility to be a hallmark of usable design,

20
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:50,420
 then this entire course could be retitled Creating Invisible Interfaces.
