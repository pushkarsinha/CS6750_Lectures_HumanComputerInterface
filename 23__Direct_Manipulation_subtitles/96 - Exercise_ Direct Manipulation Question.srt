00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,390
 Let's try a quick exercise on direct manipulation.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,615
 The Mac touchpad is famous for

3
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:06,973
 facilitating a lot of different kinds of interactions.

4
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:12,452
 For example, I can press on it to click, press the two fingers to right-click.

5
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:16,580
 I can pull up and down with two fingers to scroll up and down.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,900
 I can double tap with two fingers to scroll in and out a little bit.

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,120
 And I can pinch to zoom in and out a lot more.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,120
 Which of these are good examples of direct manipulation in action?
