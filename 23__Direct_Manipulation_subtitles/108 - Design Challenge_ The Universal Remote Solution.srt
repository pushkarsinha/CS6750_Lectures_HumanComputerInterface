1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,180
 Personally I think this is a great candidate for a voice interface.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,230
 And in fact, Comcast, Amazon and others have

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,340
 already started experimenting with voice interfaces for remote controls.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,740
 One of the challenges with voice

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,340
 interfaces is that generally the commands aren't very discoverable.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,350
 Generally, if you don't know what you can say, you have no way of finding out.

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,790
 But watching TV and movies is such a normal part of our conversations that we

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,745
 already have a vocabulary of how to say what we want to do.

9
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:28,995
 The challenge is for

10
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,865
 us designers to make a system that can understand that vocabulary.

11
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:37,245
 That way when I say, watch Community, it understands that Community is a TV show

12
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,745
 and it tries to figure out, do I grab it from the DVR,

13
00:00:39,745 --> 00:00:41,975
 do I grab it from On Demand, do I see if it's on live?

14
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:45,441
 The vocabulary for the user was very natural.

15
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:49,733
 So for example, watch Conan.

16
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:53,647
 >> Well tonight, a fan named David Joiner thinks he caught a mistake.

17
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:58,600
 He says it happened when I was telling a joke recently about Rand Paul.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,821
 >> Hey Conan, I was watching your episode on April 17th, and

19
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:04,616
 you said that Rand Paul wanted to run for president.

20
00:01:04,616 --> 00:01:04,616
 >> I had to put that in there somewhere.
