00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,900
 Depending on the area of HCI that you chose to explore,

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,240
 direct manipulation might be a big open question.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,580
 So, for gesture-based interaction for example,

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,920
 you generally not actually touching anything.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,570
 Direct manipulation is contingent on

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,300
 immediate feedback that maps directly to the interaction.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,390
 So how do you create that in a gesture-based interface?

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,940
 This is a big challenge for virtual reality as well.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,280
 Virtual reality thrives on making you feel

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,829
 like you're somewhere else both visually and auditorily,

11
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,220
 but it has a long way to go can aesthetically.

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,940
 How do you create the feeling of direct manipulation based on physical action,

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,675
 where you can only give feedback visually or auditorily?

14
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:40,400
 So, take a second, and reflect on how these principles of

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:40,400
 direct manipulation apply to your chosen area of HCI.
