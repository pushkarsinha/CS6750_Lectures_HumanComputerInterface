 The Mac Touchpad has some interesting examples of how you can make indirect

2
00:00:03,888 --> 00:00:05,623
 manipulation feel more direct.

3
00:00:05,623 --> 00:00:09,205
 For example, if I swipe from the right to the left on the touchpad with two

4
00:00:09,205 --> 00:00:12,519
 fingers, it pulls up this notification center over on the right.

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,452
 This feels direct because the notification center popped up in

6
00:00:15,452 --> 00:00:18,173
 the same place on the screen that I swiped on the touchpad.

7
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:21,290
 The touchpad is almost like a miniature version of the screen.

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,270
 But they could have placed a notification center anywhere and

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,300
 used any kind of interaction to pull it up.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,110
 This isn't like scrolling where there is something fundamental about the content

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,530
 that demands a certain kind of interaction.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,930
 They could have designed this however they wanted.

13
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,030
 But by placing the notification center there and

14
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,700
 using that interaction to pull it up, it feels more direct.

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,863
 Now, animation can also help us accomplish this.

16
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:45,247
 On the Touchpad, I can clear the windows off my desktop by kind of spreading out

17
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:47,041
 my fingers on the touchpad, and

18
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:50,290
 the animation shows them going off to the side.

19
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,765
 And while that's kind of like clearing off your desk,

20
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:56,535
 I'd argue it's not close enough to feel direct except that the animation on

21
00:00:56,535 --> 00:00:59,225
 screen mimics that action as well.

22
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,265
 The windows could have faded away or

23
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:01,555
 they could have just slid to the bottom and

24
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:04,855
 still accomplish the same function of hiding what's on my desktop.

25
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:07,945
 But the animation they chose reinforces that interaction.

26
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:09,165
 It makes it feel more direct.

27
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:12,125
 The same thing actually applies with Launchpad, which we bring up with

28
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:15,200
 the opposite function by pinching our fingers together.

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,330
 The animation looks kind of like we're pulling back a little bit or

30
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,270
 zooming out and we see the launch pad come into view,

31
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,600
 just as the gesture is similar to zooming out on the screen.

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,700
 So direct manipulation isn't just about designing interactions that

33
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,090
 feel like you're directly manipulating the interface.

34
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,380
 It's also about designing interfaces that lend themselves to

35
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:33,380
 interactions that feel more direct.
