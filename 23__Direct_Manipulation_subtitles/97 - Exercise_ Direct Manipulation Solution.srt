1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,240
 Now there's some room for disagreement here, but

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,680
 I think these five seem to be pretty cut and dry.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,640
 We can think about whether or

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,410
 not these are direct manipulation by considering whether or not what we're

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,430
 doing to the touchpad is what we'd like to do to the screen itself.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,900
 For clicking, I would consider that direct manipulation because just as we

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,740
 press directly on the screen we're pressing directly on a touchpad.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,390
 Right-clicking though, the two finger tap, doesn't really

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,760
 exemplify direct manipulation, because there's nothing natural about using

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,700
 two fingers to bring up a context menu as opposed to using one to click.

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,270
 We have to kind of learn that behavior.

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,070
 Scrolling makes sense because with scrolling it's like I'm physically

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,190
 pulling the page up and down to see different portions of it.

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,890
 The two finger tap for zooming in and

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,890
 out a little bit though isn't really direct manipulation,

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,530
 because there's no real clear reason that needs to zoom in, zoom out.

17
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,690
 Pinching on the other hand though, makes sense.

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,930
 Because it's as if I'm physically grabbing the page and

19
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,000
 shrinking and enlarging it.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,230
 So some of these I would say are pretty good examples of direct manipulation.

21
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:58,230
 While others are things that we kind of have learn to do.
