00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,538
 Distributed cognition is deeply related to the idea of cognitive load.

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:07,280
 Recall the cognitive load refers to your minds ability to only deal with

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,510
 a certain amount of information at a time.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,440
 Distributed cognition suggests that artifacts add additional

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,040
 cognitive resources.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,000
 That means the same cognitive load is distributed across a greater

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,590
 number of resources.

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,210
 Artifacts are like plugging extra memory into your brain.

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,850
 Driving is a good example of this.

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,473
 Sometimes while driving, you're cognitive load can be very, very high.

11
00:00:27,473 --> 00:00:29,920
 You have to keep track of the other cars around you.

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,110
 You have to keep track of your own speed to monitor your route planning.

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,360
 You have to make predictions about traffic patterns.

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,790
 You have to pay attention to your own level of gasoline, or in my case,

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,733
 electric charge.

16
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:42,594
 You might be attending to something in your car as well, like talking to your

17
00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:45,320
 passenger, or keeping an eye on your child in the back seat.

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,050
 It can be a big challenge.

19
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,744
 A GPS is a way of off-loading one of the tasks, navigation, on to another system.

20
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:55,980
 And thus, your cognition, is now distributed between you In the GPS.

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,110
 Turn on cruise control and now it's distributed across the car, as well.

22
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,590
 Your off loading the task of tracking your speed to the car.

23
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,530
 Every task you also de-artifacts,

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:04,530
 decreases your own personal cognitive load.
