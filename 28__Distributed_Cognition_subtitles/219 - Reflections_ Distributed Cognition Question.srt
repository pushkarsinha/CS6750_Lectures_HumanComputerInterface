00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,460
 Distributed cognition is a fun one to reflect on because we can take it

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,689
 to some pretty silly extremes.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,470
 We can go so far as to say that I don't heat up my dinner.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,088
 The system compromised of myself and the microwave heats it up.

5
00:00:11,088 --> 00:00:14,720
 And I offload the need to track the time to cook on to my microwave's timer.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,670
 And that's a perfectly valid way of looking at things.

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,590
 But what we're interested in is places where interfaces

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,950
 don't just make our lives more convenient.

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,620
 We're interested in places where they systems comprised of us and

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,390
 interfaces are capable of doing more,

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,618
 specifically because those interfaces exhibit certain cognitive qualities.

12
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:35,290
 The systems might perceive, they might remember, they might learn,

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,940
 they might act on our behalf.

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,030
 In some way they're all floating a cognitive task from us.

15
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,110
 And as a result, the system comprised of us and the interface,

16
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,470
 is capable of doing more.

17
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,980
 So reflect on that a bit, what is the place where the system comprised of you

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,890
 and some number of interfaces is capable of doing more than you alone?

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:52,890
 Specifically, because of the cognitive qualities that the interfaces possess.
