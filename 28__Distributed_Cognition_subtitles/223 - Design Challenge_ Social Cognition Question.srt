00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,820
 Let's talk about challenge of designing for social relationships.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,390
 I like to play video games.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,020
 I'm friends with people from work.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,640
 So it's natural that I might want to play games with people from work.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,100
 But at the same time,

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,850
 my relationship with people from work isn't purely social.

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,640
 If they see I'm playing a game, maybe they say,

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,520
 hey, David's got some free time.

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,340
 I should ask him to help me out with something.

10
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,190
 Or if they see I spend a lot of time playing video games, maybe they more

11
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,200
 generally say hey, David's got plenty of time to take on a new tasks.

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,670
 How do we design a social video gaming system

13
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:28,670
 that nonetheless protects against these kinds of perceptions?
