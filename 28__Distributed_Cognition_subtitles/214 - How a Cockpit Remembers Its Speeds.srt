00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,330
 In order to understand the application of distributed cognition to the cockpit,

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,070
 it's important for

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,590
 us to first understand what challenge it's addressing.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,830
 The technical reasons for this are a bit complex, and

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,300
 I strongly encourage reading the full paper to get the full picture.

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,070
 But to understand the simplified description I'll give here,

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,350
 here's what you need to know.

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,570
 When a plane is descending for landing, there exists a number of different

9
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,940
 changes the pilots need to make to the wing configurations.

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,310
 These changes are made at different speeds during the descent.

11
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,120
 When the plane slows down to a certain speed,

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,400
 it demands a certain change to the wind configuration.

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,490
 The speeds at which these configuration changes must happen

14
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,050
 differ based on a number of different variables.

15
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,625
 So for every flight there's a unique set of speeds that must be remembered.

16
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,495
 That's why the title of this paper is,

17
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:48,715
 How a Cockpit Remembers Its Speeds, Speeds, plural.

18
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,415
 It isn't just remembering how fast it's going now,

19
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:55,542
 it's remembering a sequence of speeds at which multiple changes must be made.

20
00:00:55,542 --> 00:00:59,152
 The configuration changes to the wings must be made during the descent at

21
00:00:59,152 --> 00:01:01,472
 narrowly defined times.

22
00:01:01,472 --> 00:01:03,862
 That creates a high cognitive load.

23
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:05,402
 Pilots must act quickly.

24
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:09,381
 And mistakes could mean the deaths of themselves and hundred of others.

25
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:11,421
 So how do they do this?

26
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:14,351
 First, the pilots have pages that contain the speeds for

27
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:17,361
 their descent, based on different parameters.

28
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:21,670
 The cockpit itself has an entire booklet of pages like this.

29
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,310
 So we know that the cockpit has its pilots who are responsible for

30
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,080
 actually reasoning over things.

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,120
 But that booklet forms that cockpits long term memory of different speeds for

32
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,540
 different parameters.

33
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,280
 Then, prior to the descent, the pilots find the page from that booklet

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
 that corresponds to their current parameters.

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,970
 They pull it out and pin it up inside the cockpit.

36
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,050
 That way, the sheet is accessible to both pilots.

37
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,100
 And they're able to check one another's actions throughout.

38
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,080
 This becomes one form of the cockpits short term memory,

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,980
 a temporary representation of the current speeds.

40
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,850
 At this point,

41
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,710
 we have to attribute knowledge of those speeds to the cockpit itself.

42
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,260
 If we were to isolate either pilot,

43
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,910
 they would be unable to say what the speeds are from memory, but

44
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,550
 without the pilots to interpret those speeds, the card itself is meaningless.

45
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,650
 So it's the system of the entire cockpit, including the pilots,

46
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,450
 the booklet and the current card that remembers the speeds.

47
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,100
 Then as the pilots begin the descent, they mark the different speeds right on

48
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,250
 the speedometer with these little speed bugs.

49
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,880
 The speed bugs tell them which speeds to remember

50
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,750
 in a way that can just be visually compared.

51
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,000
 When they see the speedometer pass a speed bug,

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,240
 they know it's time to make a certain change.

53
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,880
 This is like the working memory for the cockpit.

54
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,700
 The short-term memory stores the numbers in a way that the pilots can

55
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,720
 reason over, but the speed bugs on the speedometer

56
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,290
 store them in a way that they can very quickly just visually compare.

57
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,120
 They don't need to remember the numbers themselves, or do any math.

58
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,360
 All they have to do is visually compare the speed bugs to the current position

59
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,620
 of the speedometer.

60
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,630
 So what do we see from the system as a whole?

61
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,550
 Well, we see the long term memory in the book of cards.

62
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,550
 We see a short term memory in the card they selected.

63
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,980
 We see a working memory in the speed bugs on the speedometer.

64
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,778
 And we see decisions on when to make configuration changes distributed across

65
00:03:04,778 --> 00:03:06,780
 the pilots and these artifacts.

66
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,720
 No single part of this cockpit, not the pilots, not the speed bugs,

67
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,250
 not the cards, could perform the action necessary to land a plane on their own.

68
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,370
 It's only the system as a whole that does so.

69
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,040
 That's the essence of distributive cognition.

70
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,160
 The cognition involved in landing this plane is distributed

71
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,230
 across the components of the system.

72
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,940
 This is a deeper notion than just using interfaces to help us do tasks.

73
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,140
 The important thing here is that these different interfaces

74
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,140
 serve cognitive roles in the system.
