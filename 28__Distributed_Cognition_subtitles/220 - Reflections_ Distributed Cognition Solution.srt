00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,440
 Almost any interface on the computer can be analyzed from the perspective of

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,580
 distributed cognition but right now, I'm most interested in my email.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,100
 My email is an unbelievable extension of my longterm memory because whenever I

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,800
 see anything in email,

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,390
 I know I don't actually need to commit it to my own long-term memory.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,040
 It's there, it's safe forever and

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,760
 if I ever need to find it again, I'll be able to find it.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,470
 Now, finding it might take some work sometimes,

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,450
 but rarely as much work as manually remembering it.

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,360
 For me, I also mark messages as unread if I'm the one they're waiting on, or

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,150
 if I need to make sure I come back to them.

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,360
 And so, my email is an external memory of both all my communications via email,

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:34,360
 and tasks that are waiting on me to move forward.
