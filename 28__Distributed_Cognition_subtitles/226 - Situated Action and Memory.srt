00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,510
 Situated action gives us a valuable lens to examine issues of memory.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:05,990
 We mention in our lessons on memory and

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,310
 on design principles that recognition is easier than recall.

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,740
 People have an easier time recognizing the right answer, or

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,720
 option when they see it rather than recalling it from scratch.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,860
 That's in part because memory is so context dependent.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,940
 Recognition provides the necessary context to identify the right option.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,290
 Relying on recall,

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,580
 means there's little context to cue the right answer to the users memory.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,180
 Now I encountered an interesting example of

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,340
 the value of situated action a little while ago.

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,420
 My mother just had surgery.

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,712
 And so I would often go over to help her out with things.

14
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:39,750
 And everytime I would go over, she'd have four, five favors to ask me.

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,790
 Inevitably I would forget a couple of those favors and

16
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,710
 have to be reminded, but she would always remember.

17
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,590
 Why was she so much better able to remember the favors than me?

18
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,530
 Does she just have a better memory?

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,260
 She didn't make a list.

20
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,080
 She didn't write them down or anything like that.

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,030
 So the distributed cognition perspective doesn't find an external memory being

22
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,850
 used or anything like that.

23
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,650
 My hypothesis from the perspective of situated action,

24
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,510
 is that she has the context behind the tasks.

25
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,430
 She knows why they need to be done.

26
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,390
 She knows what will happen if they aren't.

27
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,230
 For her, they're part of a broader narrative.

28
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,550
 For me, they're items on a list.

29
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,350
 I have no context for why they're there.

30
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,510
 Or what would happen if they're undone.

31
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,330
 For her,

32
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,800
 they're easy to remember because they're situated in a larger context.

33
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:20,800
 For me, they're difficult because they're isolated.
