 Lucy Suchman's 1985 book "Plans and Situated

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,920
 Actions," is the seminal book on the philosophy of situated action.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,070
 The book is a detailed comparison between two views of human action.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,460
 The first view she writes views

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,245
 the organization insignificance of action as derived from plans.

6
00:00:22,245 --> 00:00:25,470
 This is the model we very often adopt when developing interfaces.

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,425
 Users make plans and users carry out those plans.

8
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:31,380
 But such then introduces a second view as well.

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,620
 In this view, people simply act in the world,

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,860
 and plans are what we derive from those actions.

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,375
 Instead of plans dictating actions,

12
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,480
 plans are interpretations of actions.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,970
 What this means for us as interface designers is that rather than

14
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,180
 assuming the user has a plan in mind that they're actively carrying out,

15
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,470
 we might consider viewing

16
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,805
 only their immediate interaction with the current screen instead.

17
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,150
 In other words, forget the history of actions that

18
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,780
 led the user to a certain screen and ask just,

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,870
 "Once they're here, how do they know what to do next?

20
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,690
 Later in the book, Lucy Suchman specifically touches

21
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,780
 on communication between humans and machines.

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,730
 There's a lot more depth here as well.

23
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,980
 The key takeaway for us is to focus on

24
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,695
 the resources available to the user at any given time,

25
00:01:15,695 --> 00:01:15,695
 but I do recommend reading the book and this chapter for more insights.
