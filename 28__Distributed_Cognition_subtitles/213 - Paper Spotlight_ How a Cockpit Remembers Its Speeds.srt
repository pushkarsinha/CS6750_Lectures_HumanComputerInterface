 One of the seminal works in

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,460
 distributed cognition research is a paper from the Journal of Cognitive Science from

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,125
 1995 called How a Cockpit Remembers Its Speeds by Edwin Hutchins.

4
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,300
 You might recognize Edwin Hutchins' name from

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,210
 our lesson on Direct Manipulation and Invisible Interfaces.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,135
 He was one of the coauthors there as well along with Don Norman.

7
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:24,030
 This is one of my favorite papers in part simply because of

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,040
 the very subtle change in emphasis that we see in the title.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,530
 We tend to think of remembering as a uniquely human or biological behavior.

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,850
 We describe computers as having memory,

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,015
 but we don't usually describe computers as remembering things.

12
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:39,460
 Remembering is more of a human behavior,

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,570
 but the paper title twist that a little bit.

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,810
 It isn't the human,

15
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,355
 it isn't the pilot remembering,

16
00:00:44,355 --> 00:00:46,050
 it's the cockpit remembering.

17
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,605
 What is the cockpit?

18
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:49,940
 The cockpit is a collection of controls,

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,420
 sensors and interfaces as well as the pilots themselves.

20
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,715
 The paper title tells us that it's this entire system,

21
00:00:56,715 --> 00:00:57,770
 the pilots, the sensors,

22
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,905
 the controls in the interfaces among them that do the remembering.

23
00:01:00,905 --> 00:01:04,790
 The system as a whole or the cockpit as a whole is remembering the speed,

24
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,610
 not just the human pilot or pilots in the cockpit.

25
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:07,610
 No individual part in isolation remembers what the system as a whole can remember.
