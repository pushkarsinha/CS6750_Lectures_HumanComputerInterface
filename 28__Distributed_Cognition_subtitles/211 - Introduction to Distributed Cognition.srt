00:00:05,781 --> 00:00:09,205
 In discussing a human-computer interaction, there's often a tendency

3
00:00:09,205 --> 00:00:11,986
 to look narrowly at the user interacting with the computer.

4
00:00:11,986 --> 00:00:15,141
 Or slightly more broadly at the user interacting with the task through some

5
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:16,430
 computer.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,070
 But many times we're interested in zooming even further out.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,144
 We're interested, not only in the interaction between the human,

8
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:24,522
 the computer and the task, but

9
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:27,180
 also in the context in which that interaction takes place.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,315
 So today we're going to look at four different models or theories,

11
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:32,920
 of the context surrounding ACI.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,080
 We'll focus primarily on distributed cognition,

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,640
 which is one of the dominant theories on the interplay between multiple agents,

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,800
 artifacts, and contexts.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,180
 We'll also touch on three other significant theories,

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:43,180
 social cognition, situated action, and activity theory.
