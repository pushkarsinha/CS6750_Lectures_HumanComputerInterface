00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,950
 Activity theory is a massive and well developed set of theories regarding

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,130
 interaction between various pieces of an activity.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,310
 The theory as a whole is so

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,700
 complex that you could teach an entire class on it alone.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,995
 It predates HCI.

6
00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:17,495
 And in fact, activity theory is one of the first places the idea of interacting

7
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:20,325
 through an interface actually came from.

8
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:23,215
 In our conversations about HCI though, there are three main

9
00:00:23,215 --> 00:00:26,990
 contributions of activity theory that I'd like you to come away with.

10
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,020
 First, when we discuss designing tasks and

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,420
 completing tasks through an interface, we risk missing a key component.

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,640
 Why?

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,460
 We could jump straight to designing the task, but

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,600
 why is the user completing the task in the first place?

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,660
 That can have significant implications for our design.

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,044
 Activity theory generalizes our unit of analysis from the task to the activity.

17
00:00:48,044 --> 00:00:50,426
 We're not just interested in what they're doing, but

18
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:53,170
 why they're doing it and what it means to them.

19
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,375
 Our designs will be different, for example, if users are using a system

20
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:59,905
 because they're required to or because they choose to.

21
00:00:59,905 --> 00:01:02,285
 Notice how this is similar to our discussion of distributed

22
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:03,875
 cognition, as well.

23
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:07,535
 In distributed cognition, we were generalizing the unit of analysis

24
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:11,410
 from a person, to a system of people and artifacts.

25
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,860
 Here, we're generalizing the unit of analysis from a task to an activity

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,800
 surrounding a task.

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,090
 In both ways, we're zooming out on the task and the design space.

28
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,470
 Second, activity theory puts an emphasis on the idea that we can create low level

29
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,500
 operations from higher level actions.

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,490
 We saw something similar to this with GOMS models,

31
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,190
 where methods were made up of operators.

32
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,900
 This has a special historical significance.

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,100
 Before activity theory and similar theories reached HCI in the 1980s,

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,410
 HCI was largely concerned with minute things,

35
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,970
 like how quickly a person can click a button or type in a command.

36
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,470
 Activity theory helped us zoom out from those low level interactions, those low

37
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,430
 level operators, to general user needs at the action or the activity levels.

38
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,550
 And third, activity theory points out that actions

39
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,170
 by the user can actually move up and down this hierarchy.

40
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,600
 A common example of this is driving a car.

41
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,640
 The first time you drove a car, shifting gears between park and

42
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,320
 drive was a very conscious action made up of operators like

43
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,818
 grabbing the gear shift and moving it in the right direction and letting go.

44
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:17,040
 You had to think about how to press the button, which way to push the stick, and

45
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,650
 when to release it.

46
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,700
 However, after driving a few times,

47
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,860
 shifting gears just becomes second nature.

48
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,200
 It becomes more like an operator.

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,371
 It shifted from being a conscious goal to an operator in your broader driving

50
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:30,960
 behavior.

51
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,700
 Notice a similarity here to our previous discussion on learning curves.

52
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,550
 How quickly an action moves from being a conscious action to a subconscious

53
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,215
 operator is also a function of how good the learning curve is on that design.

54
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:46,865
 Notice also, this is similar to the question of invisible interfaces.

55
00:02:46,865 --> 00:02:51,555
 A good invisible interface helps users focus on their actions inside the task,

56
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:51,555
 rather than the operators they use to interact with the system.
