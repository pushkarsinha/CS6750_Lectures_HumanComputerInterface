1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,980
 Something important to note is that distributed cognition isn't

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,120
 really another design principle.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,990
 Distributed cognition is more of a way of looking at interface design.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,840
 It's a way of approaching the problem that puts your attention squarely on how

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,860
 to extend the mind across artifacts.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,730
 We can actually view many of our design principles as examples of

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,680
 distributed cognition.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,520
 So this is my computer, and when I set this up,

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,250
 I wasn't thinking about it in terms of distributed cognition.

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,060
 And yet we can use distributive cognition as a lens through which to

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,550
 view this design.

12
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,250
 For example, I always have my calendar open on the right.

13
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,900
 That's a way of off loading having to keep track of my daily schedule in

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,910
 working memory.

15
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,440
 It bugs me if I have a teleconference to attend or somewhere I need to go.

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,980
 In fact I rely on this so much it gets me in trouble.

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,640
 It doesn't keep track of where I need to be for

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,740
 a given meeting and if I fail to keep track of that in working memory

19
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,520
 I might end up at home when I need to be at Georgia Tech.

20
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,680
 We can even view trivial things like a clock as an example of distributed

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,390
 cognition that prevents me from having to keep track of the passage

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,870
 of time manually.

23
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,110
 The point is that distributed cognition is a way of looking at interfaces and

24
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,780
 interface design that focuses your attention on what systems as a whole can

25
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:02,780
 accomplish as opposed to individuals on their own.
