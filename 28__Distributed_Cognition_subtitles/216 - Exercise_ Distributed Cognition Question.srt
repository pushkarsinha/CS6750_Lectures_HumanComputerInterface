00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,490
 Let's analyze a simple task from the perspective of distributed cognition.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,511
 Here we see Morgan paying some bills the old fashioned way.

3
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:11,357
 For each bill she pulls it off the pile, reads it, writes a check and

4
00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:14,720
 puts them together in a stack on the right.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,165
 Where do we delineate this system?

6
00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:16,165
 What are its parts?
