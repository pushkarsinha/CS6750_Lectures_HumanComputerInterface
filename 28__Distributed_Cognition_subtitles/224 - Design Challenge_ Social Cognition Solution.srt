1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,080
 There are lot of creative ways we might tackle this problem.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,100
 One might be a base social video game relationship around something

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,435
 like tender.

4
00:00:07,435 --> 00:00:09,950
 Tinder, if this is still around by the time your watching this,

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,790
 is a dating app were you express interest in another's in are only

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,520
 connected if they also express interest in you.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,030
 We can apply the same colonoscopy to video games.

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,870
 You can set it such that My Contacts can't just look up my game

9
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,910
 playing habits.

10
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,210
 But if they're also playing or

11
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,470
 interested in playing, they'll learn that I am playing as well.

12
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,600
 In terms of social cognition,

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,450
 that's kind of getting at the idea of an in-group.

14
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,060
 Your behaviors are only seen by those who share them and

15
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,060
 thus are in no position to judge them.
