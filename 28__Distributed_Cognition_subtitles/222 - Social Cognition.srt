1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,020
 The social portion of distributed cognition is concerned with

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,530
 how social connections create systems that can, together, accomplish tasks.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,790
 So for example, you and your friend sitting in the passenger seat, together

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,670
 form a system capable of navigating to a new destination without a GPS.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,650
 But social cognition is not only concerned with how social relationships

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,520
 combine to accomplish tasks.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,670
 It's also concerned with the cognitive underpinning of social interactions

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,770
 themselves.

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,400
 It's interested in how perception, memory, and

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,020
 learning relate to social phenomena.

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,240
 As interface designers though, why do we care?

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,865
 Well, in case you haven't noticed, one of the most common applications

13
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:38,975
 of interface design today involves social media.

14
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:40,835
 Everything is becoming social.

15
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:43,185
 Facebook tries to tell you when your friends are already nearby.

16
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:45,235
 Udacity tries to connect you with other students working on

17
00:00:45,235 --> 00:00:46,870
 the same material as you.

18
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,910
 Video games are increasingly trying to convince you to share your achievements

19
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,790
 and highlights with your friends.

20
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,190
 And yet, often times,

21
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,110
 our interfaces are at odds with how we really think about social interaction.

22
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,490
 Designing for this well involves

23
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,980
 understanding the cognitive underpinnings of social relationships.

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,180
 My Play Station, for example, has a feature for

25
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,770
 finding my real life friends, and then communicating to them my gaming habits.

26
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,670
 But really,

27
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,660
 I probably don't want them to know how much I might play video games.

28
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,890
 If I come unprepared for recording today, I certainly don't want Amanda to

29
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,000
 know it was because I was playing Skyrim for six hours last night.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,790
 So if we're going to design interfaces that integrate with social interactions,

31
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,410
 we have to understand how social interactions actually work.

32
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,900
 So an understanding of social cognition is very important

33
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:29,900
 if that's the direction you want to take.
