00:00:00,123 --> 00:00:03,501
 Distributed cognition is concerned with how the mind can be extended by

2
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:06,215
 relations with other artifacts and other individuals.

3
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:08,129
 Because we're interface designers,

4
00:00:08,129 --> 00:00:11,267
 we probably focus most of our time on the artifacts part of that.

5
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:13,345
 After all, even though we're designing tasks,

6
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:16,471
 the artifacts are what we're actually creating that's out in the world.

7
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:18,764
 But the other part of distributed cognition,

8
00:00:18,764 --> 00:00:22,601
 distributing across individuals presents a powerful opportunity as well.

9
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:24,900
 This used to be far more important, actually.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,864
 Before the days of GPS navigation,

11
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:29,816
 a different form of navigation assistance existed.

12
00:00:29,816 --> 00:00:33,072
 It was your spouse or your friend sitting in the passenger seat,

13
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:35,562
 reading a map and calling out directions to you.

14
00:00:35,562 --> 00:00:39,390
 And while mobile devices and artificial intelligence may have replaced humans in

15
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,273
 some such systems, there are still lot's of places where the role of distributing

16
00:00:43,273 --> 00:00:44,565
 across humans is crucial.

17
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:46,835
 Here's an example of this in action today.

18
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:50,469
 At Udacity, we use a tool for managing projects called JIRA.

19
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:53,832
 It breaks down projects into multiple pieces that can be moved through

20
00:00:53,832 --> 00:00:57,262
 a series of steps and assigned to different responsible individuals.

21
00:00:57,262 --> 00:01:01,353
 The entire value of JIRA is that it manages distributing tasks across

22
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,489
 members of a team.

23
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:07,014
 Thus, when a project is completed, it is completed by the system comprising

24
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:07,014
 the individual team members and JIRA itself.
