00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,040
 In this lesson, we've talked about

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,040
 distributed cognition and a couple of related theories.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,050
 The commonality of all these theories was

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,140
 their emphasis on context and integrated systems.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,020
 Distributed cognition is interested in how cognition can be

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,845
 distributed among multiple individuals and artifacts all working together.

7
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:22,770
 By taking a distributed view of interface design,

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,360
 we can think about what the combination of

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,495
 our users and our interfaces are able to accomplish.

10
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:31,065
 Situated action and activity theory give additional perspectives on this.

11
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:34,290
 Focusing respectively on the importance of ad hoc improvisation

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,985
 and the need to emphasize users' motives beyond just their goals.

13
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:40,190
 The common ground for all these theories is that

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,310
 our interfaces are not simply between the user and their task,

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:43,310
 but they also exist in some kind of greater context.
