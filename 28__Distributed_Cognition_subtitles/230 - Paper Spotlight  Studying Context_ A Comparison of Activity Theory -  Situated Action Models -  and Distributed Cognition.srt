00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,420
 In this lesson, we've covered three theories on studying

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,825
 contexts in human-computer interaction: distributed cognition,

3
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:12,600
 situated action, and activity theory.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,105
 If you're having trouble keeping the three straight though,

5
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:16,845
 Nardi has a great paper for you.

6
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:19,290
 From her volume context and consciousness,

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,230
 Nardi wrote a comparison between the three philosophies she titled

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,320
 "Studying Context: A Comparison of Activity Theory,

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,515
 Situated Action Models, and Distributed Cognition."

10
00:00:28,515 --> 00:00:32,370
 She starts by giving a great one-page summary of each of these three views,

11
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,080
 which would be really good if you're having trouble

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,615
 understanding the finer points of these theories.

13
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:38,880
 Even more usefully, she goes on to give

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,315
 commentary on the difference between these three big theories.

15
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:47,225
 First, she notes that activity theory and distributed cognition are driven by goals,

16
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:51,470
 whereas situated action de-emphasizes goals for a focus on improvisation.

17
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,620
 She goes on to summarize the situated actions as goals are

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,570
 constructed retroactively to interpret our past actions.

19
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,510
 Nardi also evaluates the role of permanent persistent structures,

20
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,615
 noting they're important for activity theory and distributed cognition,

21
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:08,120
 but present a tension for situated action.

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,315
 So, here, we again see a similarity between activity theory and distributed cognition.

23
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:14,925
 So, what makes them different?

24
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:17,660
 Well, Nardi writes that the main difference between activity theory and

25
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:22,715
 distributed cognition is their evaluation of the symmetry between people and artifacts.

26
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:25,715
 Activity theory regards them as fundamentally different,

27
00:01:25,715 --> 00:01:27,970
 given that humans have consciousness.

28
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:33,350
 Distributed cognition by contrast believes that artifacts can serve cognitive roles,

29
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,090
 and so those should be considered conceptually equivalent to humans.

30
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,630
 So, that gives a high-level overview of the difference between these three theories.

31
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,700
 These theories are big and complex, of course,

32
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,965
 and the complete paper goes into much more detail.

33
00:01:45,965 --> 00:01:47,780
 But this should provide a decent glimpse at

34
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:47,780
 the distinctions at least enough to get you started reading the paper for yourself.
