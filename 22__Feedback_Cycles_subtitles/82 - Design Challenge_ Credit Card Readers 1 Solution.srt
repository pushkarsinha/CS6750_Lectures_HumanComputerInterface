1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,850
 First, in terms of the gulf of execution,

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,100
 the insertion method is actually physically easier to do.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,880
 While you can be both too fast and too slow with the sliding method,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,130
 you can't push it too far in with the insertion method.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,730
 So you know if there's an error,

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,280
 it's because the card isn't far enough into the reader.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,390
 And second, there's rich feedback with the insertion method.

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,780
 It doesn't even have to come from the screen telling you that you didn't

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,870
 do it correctly.

10
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,346
 You feel the card stop when it's far enough into the reader.

11
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:26,586
 You have immediate physical feedback on whether you're putting it in the right

12
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:29,824
 place, and whether you've actually put it far enough in, rather than delayed

13
00:00:29,824 --> 00:00:29,824
 feedback asking you to try again after some kind of waiting period.
