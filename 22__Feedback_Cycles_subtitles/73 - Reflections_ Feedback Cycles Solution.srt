00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,190
 It's not a coincidence that I'm filming this in my basement.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,150
 This actually happened to me a few weeks ago.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,029
 The circuit to our basement was tripped, which is where we keep our modem, so

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,100
 our internet was out.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,270
 Now this is a brand new house and it was the first time we tripped a breaker, so

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,950
 I pulled out my flashlight and I opened the panel.

7
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,760
 And none of the labels over here clearly corresponded to the breaker I was

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,140
 looking for over here.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,180
 I ended up trying every single one of them and still it didn't work.

10
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,940
 I shut off everything in the house.

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,460
 Why didn't it work?

12
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,360
 In reality,

13
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,810
 there was a reset button on the outlet itself that had to be pressed.

14
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,200
 The only reason we noticed it was because my wife noticed something out of

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,620
 the corner of her eye turning on and off as I switched these.

16
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,940
 That was a terribly large gulf of execution.

17
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,030
 I knew what I wanted to accomplish,

18
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,230
 I could translate it into the system's terms easily, reset a breaker.

19
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,600
 But figuring out the actions to accomplish that goal was very difficult.

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,080
 That's a large gulf of execution.

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,769
 How was that?

22
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:50,479
 >> [SOUND] What?

23
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,837
 Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

24
00:00:52,837 --> 00:00:54,115
 >> You weren't watching?

25
00:00:54,115 --> 00:00:57,850
 [LAUGH] So I have no way of knowing if that was good or not?

26
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,050
 Isn't that a terrible gulf of evaluation?

27
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,320
 I joke, but a lack of feedback on your performance at a task,

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,360
 whether it be filming, like I'm doing now or doing a project like youâ€™ll

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,360
 do later in our material, presents the same kind of poor gulf of evaluation.
