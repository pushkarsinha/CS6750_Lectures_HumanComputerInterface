00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,765
 Here are five quick tips for bridging gulfs of execution.

2
00:00:06,765 --> 00:00:09,885
 Number one, make functions discoverable.

3
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:13,380
 Imagine a user is sitting in front of your interface for the very first time.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,015
 How would they know what they can do?

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,670
 Do they have to read the documentation, take a class?

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,415
 Ideally, the functions of the interface will be discoverable.

7
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:24,000
 Meaning that they can find them clearly labeled within the interface.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,715
 Number two, let the user mess around.

9
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:29,040
 You want your user to poke around and discover things,

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,915
 make them feel safe in doing so.

11
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:33,120
 Don't include any actions that can't be undone.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,590
 Avoid any buttons that can irreversibly ruin their document or set up.

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,215
 That way the user will feel safe discovering things in your interface.

14
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:43,500
 Number three, be consistent with other tools.

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,340
 We all want to try new things and innovate,

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,605
 but we can bridge gulf of execution nicely,

17
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:50,525
 by adopting the same standards that many other tools use.

18
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:53,355
 Use ctrl c for copy and ctrl v for paste.

19
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:57,560
 Use a diskette icon for save even though no one actually uses floppy disks anymore.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,430
 This makes it easy for users to figure out what to do in your interface.

21
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,840
 Number four, know your user.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,575
 The Gulf of Execution has a number of components: Identifying intentions,

23
00:01:07,575 --> 00:01:09,050
 identifying the actions to take,

24
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,480
 and taking the actions.

25
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,390
 For novice users, identifying their intentions and actions are most valuable.

26
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,725
 So, making commands discoverable through things like menus is preferable.

27
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:21,575
 For experts though, actually doing the action is more valuable.

28
00:01:21,575 --> 00:01:23,630
 That's why many experts prefer the command line,

29
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,250
 although it lacks many usability principles targeted at novices, it's very efficient.

30
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,790
 Number five, feedforward.

31
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,304
 We've talked about feedback,

32
00:01:32,304 --> 00:01:34,520
 which is a response to something that the user did.

33
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,355
 Feedforward is more like feedback on what the user might want to do.

34
00:01:38,355 --> 00:01:41,405
 It helps the user predict what the result of an action will be.

35
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:44,060
 For example, when you pull down the Facebook news feed on your phone,

36
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,860
 it starts to show the little refresh icon.

37
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,440
 If you don't finish pulling down, it doesn't refresh.

38
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,185
 That's feedforward. Information on what will happen if you keep doing what you're doing.

39
00:01:53,185 --> 00:01:56,840
 Many of these tips are derived from some of the fundamental principles of design,

40
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,510
 pioneered by people like Don Norman and Jacob Nielsen,

41
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,510
 and we'll cover them more in another lesson.
