00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,490
 Today, we've talked about, arguably,

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,660
 the most fundamental concept of human-computer interaction, feedback cycles.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,870
 We describe feedback cycles for our purposes as the exchange of input

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,365
 and output between a user and a system to accomplish some goal.

5
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:20,505
 We discussed feedback cycles' incredible ubiquity in other fields and discussions.

6
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:22,470
 We talked about gulf of execution,

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,780
 the distance between knowing what they want to accomplish and

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,750
 actually executing the steps necessary to accomplish it.

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,670
 We talked about gulf of evaluation,

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,620
 the distance between making some change in

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,930
 the system and evaluating whether or not the goal was accomplished.

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,445
 We introduced the seven questions we need to ask ourselves to bridge those gulfs.

13
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:41,185
 Now that we understand these goals,

14
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:41,185
 our next goal is to understand methods for crossing them.
