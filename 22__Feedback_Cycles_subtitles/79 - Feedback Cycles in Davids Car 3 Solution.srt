00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,800
 So here are a few ideas that I had.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,520
 We know that the screen can show an alert when you try to turn the car on

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,400
 without pressing the brake pedal down.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,690
 Why not show that alert as soon as the driver gets in the car every time?

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,420
 That doesn't widen the gulf of execution for an expert user, but

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,995
 it does narrow it for a novice user,

7
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:18,240
 because even a novice can see that alert the first time they get in the car.

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,490
 But what still throws me off to this day is the sound the car makes when you try

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,510
 and turn it on.

10
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,594
 Watch.

11
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:27,440
 [SOUND] Did the car turn on?

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,432
 No. It didn't that time.

13
00:00:29,432 --> 00:00:35,385
 [SOUND] Now it turned on.

14
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:38,599
 So it plays the same sound initially when you press the button and then plays

15
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:41,672
 a different follow up sound to confirm that the car actually turned on.

16
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:44,517
 I know why they do this, that one sound just confirms that you pressed

17
00:00:44,517 --> 00:00:47,827
 the button successfully while the other sound confirms that the car turned on.

18
00:00:47,827 --> 00:00:51,155
 But for me, I would just as soon have two different sounds confirm whether or

19
00:00:51,155 --> 00:00:53,820
 not you just pressed the button or whether the car turned on.

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,790
 That way, just the presence of a sound confirms the fact that the button was

21
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,790
 pressed and the nature of the sound confirms the effect of that press.
