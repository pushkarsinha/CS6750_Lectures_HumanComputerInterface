 Lately I've encountered another interesting example of

2
00:00:03,107 --> 00:00:04,345
 feedback cycles in action.

3
00:00:04,345 --> 00:00:06,110
 You may have actually seen this before as well.

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,300
 They're the new credit card readers.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,310
 My wife sells arts and crafts at local events, and so

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,100
 she has these Square readers that can scan credit cards on her phone.

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,730
 One version lets you swipe, and the new version lets you insert the card.

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,200
 So let's check this out real quick.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,790
 With the swipe version you just insert the card and pull it through,

10
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,770
 just like a traditional card reader.

11
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,640
 The problem is there's typically no feedback on whether you're swiping

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,640
 correctly.

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,970
 And what's more is you can be wrong in both directions.

14
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,520
 You can be both too fast or too slow.

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,360
 So you may have had a time when you were trying to swipe a credit card on some

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,370
 kind of reader, and you kept doing it more and more slowly and deliberately,

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,690
 thinking that the problem was that you had done it too fast originally.

18
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,560
 And then you discover that you've actually been going too slowly all along

19
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,160
 and your slowing down was actually counterproductive.

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,720
 There's no feedback here and

21
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,450
 the space and acceptable input is bounded on both sides.

22
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,810
 You have to go above one speed and below another speed.

23
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,730
 But now credit card readers

24
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:00,240
 are moving to this model where you just insert the card.

25
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,940
 You try, at least.

26
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:01,940
 In terms of feedback cycles, in what ways is this actually better?
