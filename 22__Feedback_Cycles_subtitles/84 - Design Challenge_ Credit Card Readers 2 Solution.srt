1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,130
 There are a few things we could do here.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,850
 We might build some kind of buzzer into the card reader to

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,800
 let the customer know when they can take their card out.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,675
 That would make sure that they don't leave without it.

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,392
 ATM machines often do this, actually.

6
00:00:10,392 --> 00:00:13,327
 They'll ring a buzzer until the card and the cash are removed.

7
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:15,377
 But that's noisy and potentially irritating.

8
00:00:15,377 --> 00:00:18,700
 It would mess with the ambiance of a restaurant or something like that.

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,120
 We could do something super complicated,

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,120
 like pair the credit card with a smartphone and

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,430
 ring the phone when it gets too far away from the credit card.

12
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,860
 But that requires adding some new technology to every single credit card,

13
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,440
 which could be a pretty big expense.

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,640
 So what about something simpler?

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,070
 Why not force a customer to remove the credit card in order to get the receipt

16
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,272
 and their goods?

17
00:00:36,272 --> 00:00:38,415
 Unless they're going to walk away without what they came to buy,

18
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:38,415
 that'll ensure that they remember their card.
