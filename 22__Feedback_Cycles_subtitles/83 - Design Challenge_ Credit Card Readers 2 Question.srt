1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,980
 So, using the insertion method is significantly easier.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,780
 However, the insertion method introduces a new problem.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,480
 With the sliding method, I never had to actually physically let go of my card,

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,900
 so there was little chance of me walking away without it.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,340
 With the insertion method, I insert the card and I wait.

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,870
 I'm not used to having to remember to retrieve my card from the card reader.

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,700
 Now this isn't quite as big a deal with these new portable readers, but for

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,440
 the mounted ones you see in stores it can be far more problematic.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,520
 So how can we build some feedback into the system to make sure people

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:32,520
 remember their cards when they walk away?
