1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,230
 Well, what do we know?

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,660
 We know the car was off.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,280
 We know this is clearly the power button based on how it's labeled and

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,680
 where it's located.

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,410
 And most importantly,

6
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,570
 when I pressed it we heard kind of a happy confirmation-y sound.

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,425
 So did the car turn on?

8
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:15,535
 Actually, it didn't.

9
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:17,485
 To turn this car on you have press the brake petal

10
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,235
 while pressing the on button.

11
00:00:19,235 --> 00:00:21,455
 The car doesn't do a great job of helping us across that goal

12
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:22,555
 of execution.

13
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,495
 There's no indicator that you're doing it wrong until you've actually already

14
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:26,625
 done it wrong.

15
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,545
 But the car does give us a short gulf of evaluation.

16
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:32,755
 If you do it incorrectly, an alert pops up on the dashboard letting you know you

17
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:35,545
 need to press the brake pedal and then press the on button.

18
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:38,210
 The output presented is easy to interpret.

19
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,620
 As presented in the context of when you need to know that information, so

20
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,120
 you kind of understand that itâ€™s a response to what you just did.

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,590
 So here we have some trouble with the gulf of execution but

22
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,970
 the gulf of evaluation is still pretty short.

23
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,850
 So now that I see this message I press down the brake pedal,

24
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:52,850
 press the on button [SOUND] and now the car is on.
