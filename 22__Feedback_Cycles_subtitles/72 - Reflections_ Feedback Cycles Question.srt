00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,067
 Let's pause for a second, and reflect on the roles of gulfs of execution and

2
00:00:04,067 --> 00:00:05,880
 gulfs of evaluation in our own lives.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,430
 So try to think of a time when you've encountered a wide gulf of execution,

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,630
 and a wide gulf of evaluation.

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,730
 This doesn't have to be a computer, it could be any interface.

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,270
 In other words, what was a time when you were interacting with an interface, but

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,420
 couldn't think of how to accomplish what you wanted to accomplish?

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,240
 What was a time when you were interacting with an interface and

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:22,240
 couldn't tell if you'd accomplished what you wanted to accomplish?
