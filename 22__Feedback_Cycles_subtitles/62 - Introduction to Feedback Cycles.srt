00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:06,282
 [NOISE] Feedback cycles are the way in which people interact with the world,

2
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:11,370
 and then get feedback on the results of those interactions.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,160
 We'll talk about the ubiquity of those feedback cycles.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,020
 Then we'll talk about the gulf of execution, which is the distance between

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,710
 a user's goals and the execution of the actions required to realize those goals.

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,010
 Then we'll talk about the Gulf of evaluation,

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,380
 which is the distance between the effects of those actions and

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,850
 the user's understanding of those results.

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,720
 We'll discuss seven questions we should ask ourselves when designing feedback

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,120
 cycles for users and

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,120
 we'll also look at applications of these in multiple areas of our everyday lives.
