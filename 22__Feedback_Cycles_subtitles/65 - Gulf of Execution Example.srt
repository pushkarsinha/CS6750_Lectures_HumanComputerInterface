1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,570
 Let's take a simple example of the gulf of execution.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,514
 I'm making my lunch, I have my bowl of chili in the microwave.

3
00:00:06,514 --> 00:00:09,340
 My goal is simple, I want to heat it up.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,005
 How hard is that?

5
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:12,419
 Well, typically when I've been cooking in the past,

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,999
 cooking is defined in terms of the amount of time it takes.

7
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:18,820
 So, in the context of this system, I specify my intent as to microwave it for

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,200
 one minute.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:27,690
 Now what are the actions necessary to do so?

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,253
 I press Time Cook to enter the time-cooking mode, I enter the time,

11
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:32,920
 one minute, and I press Start.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,580
 I didn't press Start just now, but I would press Start.

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,220
 I specified my intent, microwave for one minute.

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,924
 I specified my actions, pressing the right sequence of buttons, and

15
00:00:41,924 --> 00:00:43,377
 I executed those actions.

16
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,210
 Could we make this better?

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,100
 There were a lot of button presses to microwave for just one minute.

18
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,780
 If we think that's a common behavior, we might be able to make it simpler.

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,093
 Instead of pressing Time Cook one, zero, zero and Start,

20
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:56,893
 I might just press one and wait.

21
00:00:56,893 --> 00:01:01,151
 Watch.

22
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:05,761
 [NOISE] So I've narrowed the gulf of execution by shrinking the number

23
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:10,053
 of actions required, but I may have enlarged it by making it more

24
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:13,170
 difficult to identify the actions required.

25
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,471
 When I look at the microwave,

26
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:16,720
 Time Cook gives me an idea of what that button does.

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,830
 So if I'm a novice at this, I can discover how to accomplish my goal.

28
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,230
 That's good for the gulf of execution.

29
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,920
 It's easier to look at the button and figure out what to do than to have to go

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,300
 look, read a manual, or anything like that and find out on your own.

31
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,350
 But once you know that all you have to do is press one,

32
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,340
 that's much easier to execute.

33
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,140
 That's something nice about this interface, it caters to both novices and

34
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,830
 experts, there's a hard and discoverable way and a short and visible way.

35
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,840
 But let's rewind all the way back to the goal I set up initially,

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
 my goal was to heat up my chili.

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,900
 I specified my intent in terms of the system as microwaving it for one minute.

38
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,750
 But was that the right thing to do?

39
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,371
 After one minute, my chili might not be hot enough, this microwave actually has

40
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:58,516
 an automatic reheat function that senses the food's temperature and

41
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:00,023
 stops when the time seems right.

42
00:02:00,023 --> 00:02:03,884
 So the best bridge over the gulf of execution might also involve helping me

43
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:05,800
 reframe my intention.

44
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,199
 Instead of going to microwave for one minute, it might encourage me to reframe

45
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,199
 this as simply heating until ready and letting the microwave do the rest.
