1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,410
 Feedback cycles are incredibly ubiquitous, whether or

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,900
 not there's a computational interface involved.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,520
 Everything from reading to driving a car to interacting with other people

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,345
 could be an example of a feedback cycle in action.

5
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:17,020
 They're how we learn everything, from how to walk to how to solve a Rubik's

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,320
 cube to how to take the third order partial derivative of a function.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,270
 I assume, I've never done that.

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,430
 We do something, we see the result, and

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,220
 we adjust what we do the next time accordingly.

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,880
 You may have even seen other examples of this before, too.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,960
 If you've taken Ashok's and mine knowledge-based AI class,

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,400
 we talk about how agents are constantly interacting with, learning from, and

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,910
 affecting the world around them.

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,280
 That's a feedback cycle.

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,997
 If you've taken cyber physical systems course,

16
00:00:41,997 --> 00:00:44,548
 you've seen this this without human involved at all,

17
00:00:44,548 --> 00:00:47,930
 as a system can autonomously read input and react accordingly.

18
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,660
 Under some definitions, some people would even call this the artificial

19
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,520
 intelligence, specifically because it mimics what a human actually does.

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,490
 They act in the world and they evaluate the result.

21
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,860
 In fact, if you look at some of the definitions of intelligence out there,

22
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,519
 you'll find that many people actually define feedback cycles as the hallmark

23
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,940
 of intelligent behavior.

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,520
 Or they might define intelligence as abilities that must be

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,640
 gained through feedback cycles.

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,088
 Colvin's definition, for example, involves adjusting to one's environment,

27
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:16,898
 which means acting in it and then evaluating the results.

28
00:01:16,898 --> 00:01:18,370
 Dearborn's definition of learning or

29
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,360
 profiting by experience is exactly this as well.

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,800
 You do something and experience the results, and learn from it.

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,910
 Adaptive behavior in general can be considered an example of

32
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,010
 a feedback cycle.

33
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,110
 Behavior means acting in the world.

34
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,090
 And adapting means processing the results and

35
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,330
 changing your behavior accordingly.

36
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,040
 And most generally, Schank's definition

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,500
 is clearly an ability gained through feedback cycles, getting better over

38
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,110
 time based on evaluation of the results of one's actions in the world.

39
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,920
 And Schank's general definition, getting better over time, is clearly something

40
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,960
 that can happen as a result of participation in a feedback cycle.

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,990
 We find that nearly all of HCI can be interpreted in some ways as

42
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,910
 an application of feedback cycles, whether between a person and

43
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,460
 a task, a person and

44
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:02,460
 an interface, or systems comprised of multiple people and multiple interfaces.
