00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,450
 I asked you earlier to pick an area of HCI in which you're

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,330
 interested and reflect on it as you go through this course.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,980
 Depending on the area you selected,

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,725
 feedback cycles can play a huge number of different roles.

5
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:15,000
 In health care, for example,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,090
 feedback cycles are critical to helping patients manage their symptoms.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,200
 That relies on the results of certain tests being easy to interpret and evaluate.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,360
 Feedback cycles are also present in some of

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,805
 the bigger challenges for gesture-based interactions.

10
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:29,160
 It can be difficult to get feedback on how system interpreted

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,770
 a certain gesture and why it interpreted it that way.

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,110
 Compare that to touch, where it's generally

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,465
 very easy to understand where you touched the screen.

14
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:38,040
 So, think for a moment about how

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,040
 feedback cycles affect the area you chose to keep in mind.
