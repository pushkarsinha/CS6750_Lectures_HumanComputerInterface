00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,190
 Before cars had push button starts,

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,050
 this is where you inserted the key to turn on the ignition.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:05,913
 Why?

4
00:00:05,913 --> 00:00:07,560
 I have no idea.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,910
 But I do know that now,

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,810
 the start button can be placed in any number of different locations.

7
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,270
 So why do we put it where we've always put it?

8
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,580
 Well, the reason is, that's where the driver expects it to be placed.

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,600
 We help them across the gulf of execution by designing a system that's

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,328
 consistent with their expectations about how it should work.

11
00:00:23,328 --> 00:00:27,350
 It makes it easier for them to translate their intentions into actions.

12
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,340
 Now, other times we might violate this principle because of some other benefits

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,390
 we hope to gain.

14
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,420
 But generally speaking, when all else is equal,

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:33,420
 we want to stay consistent with the way users expect our systems to work.
