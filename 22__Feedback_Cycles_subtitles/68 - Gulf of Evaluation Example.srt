1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,380
 Let's take a thermostat, for example.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,830
 I have a goal to make the room warmer, so

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,470
 I do something to my thermostat with the intention of making the room warmer.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,330
 What does the system do as a result?

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,300
 Well, it turns the heat on, that would be the successful result of my action.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,585
 But how do I know that the heat was turned on?

7
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:19,067
 Well, maybe I can hear it, I might hear it click on.

8
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:21,230
 But that's a one time kind of thing and it might be quiet.

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,490
 And if I'm mishearing it, I have no way of double checking it.

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,590
 So I'm not sure if I heard it, and I have to go find a vent and

11
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,650
 put my hand on it and try to feel the heat coming out.

12
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,590
 And there's more going on in a heater, it might have worked,

13
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,270
 but the heater doesn't immediately turn on for one reason or the other.

14
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,130
 These are signs of a large gulf of evaluation.

15
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,310
 Neither the sound or the vent are optimal displays because they're either

16
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,680
 hard to reach or possible to miss.

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,860
 Feeling the heat might be easy to interpret, but

18
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,910
 hearing the heater turn on might not.

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,620
 So either way, I have to do a lot to evaluate whether or

20
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,580
 not my action was successful.

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,890
 And this is all for a very small piece of feedback.

22
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,700
 Ideally if I wasn't successful, we want the system to also tell me why I wasn't

23
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,840
 successful so I can evaluate what I did wrong and respond accordingly.

24
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,390
 There's a very large gulf of evaluation if there's no indicator on the actual

25
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,140
 thermostat.

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,410
 So how can we resolve that?

27
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,580
 Well, simple.

28
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,120
 We just mark on the thermostat that the heat is on.

29
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,440
 That sounds trivial, but

30
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,490
 nothing in the fundamental design of this system demanded a note like this.

31
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,830
 It's only in thinking about the system from the perspective of the user

32
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,790
 that we find that need.

33
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,260
 I can let you know as well, this system still isn't very ideal.

34
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,970
 For various reasons, it'll turn the heater on or

35
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,070
 the air conditioning off even when it hasn't reached the temperature I put in.

36
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,560
 And it gives me no indication of why.

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,286
 I can look at the system and evaluate that the temperature is set to lower

38
00:01:37,286 --> 00:01:38,931
 than the current temperature in the room.

39
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:42,410
 But at the same time, I can see that the heater isn't on.

40
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,445
 Under those circumstances, I have no way of knowing if the heater's

41
00:01:45,445 --> 00:01:48,870
 malfunctioning, if the switch is wrong, or I don't even know.

42
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,951
 In this case, it might just be that it's set to the wrong mode.

43
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:55,709
 The mode is visible, but after I remembered to check it,

44
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:57,385
 it appears to be malfunctioning.

45
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,447
 We can imagine an alternative message on the screen indicating the direction

46
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:03,506
 of the relationship or something similar that would give some sign that it's

47
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:03,506
 currently set incorrectly.
