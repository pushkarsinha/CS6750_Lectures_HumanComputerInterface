1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,470
 Finally, the final step for need-finding is to define our requirements.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,689
 These are the requirements that our final interface must meet.

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,240
 They should be specific and evaluatable,

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,420
 and they can include some components that are outside of users tasks,

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,670
 as well, as defined by the project requirements.

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,170
 In terms of user tasks, we might have requirements for guarding functionality,

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,990
 what the interface can actually do, usability, how certain user interactions

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,890
 must work, learnability, how fast the user can start to use the interface, and

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,120
 accessibility, who can use the interface.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,680
 We might also have some that are generated by external project

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,510
 requirements, like compatibility, what devices the interface can run on,

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,990
 compliance, how the interface protects user privacy, cost,

13
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,340
 how much the final tool can actually cost, and so on.

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:44,340
 We'll use these to evaluate the interfaces we develop, going forward.
