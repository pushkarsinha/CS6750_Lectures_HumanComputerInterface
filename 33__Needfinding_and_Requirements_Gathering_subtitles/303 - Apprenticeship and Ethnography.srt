1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,600
 If we're designing interfaces for particularly complex tasks,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,480
 we might quickly find out that just talking to our participants or

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,400
 observing them really isn't enough to get the understanding we need to design

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,710
 those interfaces.

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,655
 For particularly complex tasks, we might need to become

6
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:17,825
 experts ourselves in order to design those programs.

7
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:19,995
 This is informed by the domain of ethnography,

8
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:22,595
 which recommends researching a community or

9
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:26,245
 a job or anything like that, by becoming a participant in it.

10
00:00:26,245 --> 00:00:28,085
 It goes beyond just participant observation though,

11
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:31,250
 it's really about integrating oneself into that area and

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,050
 becoming an expert in it and learning about it as you go.

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,630
 So we bring in our expertise and design in HCI and use that combined with

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,110
 the expertise that we develop to create new interfaces for those people.

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,340
 So for example, our video editors here at Udacity have an incredible

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,240
 incredibly complex workflow involving multiple programs, multiple workflows,

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,210
 lots of different people and lots of moving parts.

18
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,490
 There's no possible way I could ever sit down with someone for

19
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,225
 just an hour and get a good enough picture of what they do, to design

20
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:01,675
 a new interface that will help them out, I really need to train under them.

21
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:04,165
 I really need to become an expert at video editing and

22
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:06,565
 recording myself, in order to help them out.

23
00:01:06,565 --> 00:01:08,815
 It's kind of like an apprenticeship approach.

24
00:01:08,815 --> 00:01:11,145
 They would apprentice me in their field and

25
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:15,112
 I would use the knowledge that I gain to design new interfaces to help them out.

26
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:18,272
 So ethnography and apprenticeship are huge fields of research

27
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:20,142
 both on their own and as they apply to HCI.

28
00:01:20,142 --> 00:01:22,842
 So if you're interested in using that approach

29
00:01:22,842 --> 00:01:22,842
 take a look at some of the resources that we're providing.
