1
00:00:00,082 --> 00:00:03,080
 Sometimes it's not just enough to watch people engaging in a task.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,265
 Sometimes we want to experience a task for ourselves.

3
00:00:06,265 --> 00:00:07,740
 So that's what I'm going to do.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,510
 I listen to audiobooks a lot.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,730
 I don't really exercise.

6
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,057
 I should, but I don't.

7
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:13,120
 But I'm going to try this out.

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,560
 So I've got my audiobook queued up, I've got my mic on so

9
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,070
 I can take notes as I run.

10
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:25,446
 So I'm going to go on a jog and see what I discover.

11
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:27,070
 So what did I learn?

12
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,750
 I learned that I'm out of shape for one thing.

13
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,090
 I already knew that but I learned it again.

14
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,160
 I also learned that this app would be very useful for

15
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,090
 anyone doing participant observation on exercisers.

16
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,180
 Because I kept having to stop to record notes for myself,

17
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,420
 which I could have done with this app that I'm trying to implement.

18
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,347
 But aside from that, I noticed that unexpected things happen pretty often

19
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:46,495
 that made me wish that I could easily go back in my book.

20
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:49,113
 Or sometimes there are just things I just wanted to hear again, but

21
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:50,387
 there was no easy way to do that.

22
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:52,800
 I also notice that there's definitely the need there for me.

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,990
 I already planned to listen to everything again now that I'm home

24
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,430
 because there were notes I wanted to take that I couldn't take easily.

25
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,368
 I also noticed that while sometimes I wanted to take notes,

26
00:01:02,368 --> 00:01:04,700
 sometimes I also just want to leave a bookmark.

27
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,520
 Now we do have to be careful here though.

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,980
 Remember you are not your user.

29
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,390
 When you're working as a participant observer, you can avail useful insights,

30
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,440
 but you shouldn't over represent your own experiences.

31
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,650
 You should use this experience as a participant observer to inform what

32
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:18,650
 you ask users going forward
