00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,380
 Here's my answer to this very complicated exercise.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,880
 Two methods that analyze data that already exists

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,380
 are Naturalistic Observation and Errors and Hacks.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,690
 Naturalistic Observation doesn't necessarily analyze data that

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,320
 already exists, but

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,740
 it analyzes data that's being produced already on its own without observing it,

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,900
 so we don't have to go out and create an opportunity for data to happen.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,800
 We just have to observe it and capture it where it's already taking place.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,520
 Errors and Hacks, look at the way users already use interfaces to see what

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,870
 errors they regularly make or when they have to work around the interface.

11
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,340
 The two methods that require no recruitment are Naturalistic Observation

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,180
 and Participant Observation.

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,120
 In both cases, we don't need other human participants to

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,050
 come do anything differently based on the fact that we're doing some research.

15
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,460
 With interviews, surveys, Focus Groups, apprenticeship and Think-Aloud, we're

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,930
 always asking users to do something to accommodate us or to give us some data.

17
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,270
 And with Errors and Hacks, even if we can view that data on our own,

18
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,080
 we still need the user to give us permission to view their workspace or

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,010
 watch them do whatever they're doing.

20
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,521
 There might be some times when you can look for Errors and

21
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:08,621
 Hacks with Naturalistic Observation, but generally you need to get

22
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:11,722
 enough into the users head to understand why something's an error or

23
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:13,336
 why they need to use a certain hack.

24
00:01:13,336 --> 00:01:14,124
 For the most part,

25
00:01:14,124 --> 00:01:16,790
 all of these are going to need some synchronous participation.

26
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,640
 There might be some exceptions.

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,140
 For example, we could do a retrospective analysis of Errors and Hacks, or

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,950
 we can have someone do a Think-Aloud protocol where they actually write down

29
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,810
 their thoughts after doing a task.

30
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,780
 But generally speaking,

31
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,990
 the way most of these are usually done, they require synchronous participation.

32
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,510
 Surveys are the exception.

33
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,050
 Surveys we usually send out to someone,

34
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,220
 wait some period of time, and get back the results.

35
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,110
 So we never have to be interacting live with any of our participants.

36
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:41,970
 That's one of the reasons why

37
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,760
 surveys can get a lot more data than other methods.

38
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,430
 Adding more participants doesn't necessarily require more of our time,

39
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,530
 at least not to gather the data in the first place.

40
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,672
 Analyzing it might require more time at the end, but

41
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:54,091
 that's not synchronous either.

42
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:57,211
 As far as investigating participant thoughts is concerned,

43
00:01:57,211 --> 00:02:00,698
 almost all these methods can investigate this when used correctly.

44
00:02:00,698 --> 00:02:04,419
 We could do a survey does not actually investigate participants thoughts, but

45
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:07,694
 a well designed survey is going to trying get a heart of the users thinks

46
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:08,699
 about things.

47
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,660
 The only exception is Naturalistic Observation where by definition,

48
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,400
 we're just watching people we're not interacting with them or

49
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,860
 we're not asking them what they are thinking.

50
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,230
 It's always extremely valuable for us to be able to do some needfinding that

51
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,880
 occurs within the task context itself.

52
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,810
 And unfortunately interviews and surveys,

53
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,490
 which are some of our most common data gathering methods,

54
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,680
 very often don't occur within the task context.

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,960
 Naturalistic Observation and Participant Observation obviously do, but

56
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,160
 since they don't involved getting inside the real users head,

57
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,136
 their contributions are a little bit more limited.

58
00:02:40,136 --> 00:02:44,810
 Apprenticeship and Think-Aloud really capture the benefits of occurring within

59
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,260
 the task context, because either way we get the user's thoughts

60
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,410
 while they're engaging with the task, or immediately thereafter.

61
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,030
 It is possible to do interviews and

62
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,730
 Focus Groups within the task contexts as well, it just isn't quite as common.

63
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,750
 Errors and Hacks are certainly debatable as well, because the Errors and

64
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,950
 Hacks themselves definitely occur within the task context, but

65
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,400
 our analysis of them usually doesn't.

66
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,990
 And finally, as we talk about when we discuss cognitive task analysis,

67
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,110
 one of the challenges with needfinding is that most of our approaches

68
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,440
 are extremely expensive.

69
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,580
 If we want to gather a lot of data cheaply,

70
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,060
 then we probably need to rely on surveys.

71
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,320
 Everything else is either going to incur a pretty significant cost or

72
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,140
 it just isn't capable of gathering a lot of data.

73
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,840
 For example, we could cheaply be participant observations for

74
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,990
 weeks on end, but

75
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:30,990
 we're only ever going to gather data from one person and that's never ideal.
