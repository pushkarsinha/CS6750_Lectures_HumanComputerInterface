00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,400
 In this lesson we've covered a wide variety of different methods for

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,700
 need finding.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,170
 Each method has its own disadvantages and advantages.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,770
 So let's start to wrap up the lesson by exploring this with an exercise.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,870
 Here are the methods we've covered, and here are the potential advantages.

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,884
 For each row, for each advantage,

7
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:21,523
 mark which need-finding method actually has that advantage.

8
00:00:21,523 --> 00:00:23,662
 Note that these might be somewhat relative, so

9
00:00:23,662 --> 00:00:25,770
 your answer may differ from ours.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,940
 Go ahead and skip to the exercise if you don't want to listen to me

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,270
 read these out.

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,439
 The columns from left to right are Naturalistic Observation,

13
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,750
 Participant Observation, Errors and Hacks, Interviews,

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,820
 Surveys, Focus Groups, Apprenticeship, and Think-Aloud.

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,210
 The potential advantages are Analyzes data that already exists,

16
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,290
 Requires no recruitment, Requires no synchronous participation,

17
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:55,360
 Investigates the participant's thoughts, occurs within the task context, and

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:55,360
 cheaply gathers lots of users' data.
