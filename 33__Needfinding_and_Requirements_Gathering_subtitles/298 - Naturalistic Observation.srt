1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,120
 For certain tasks, a great way for

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,720
 us to understand the users need is to simply watch.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,315
 A great way for

4
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:09,689
 me to start understanding what it's like to need an audiobook app for exercising

5
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:13,027
 is to come somewhere where people are exercising and just watch them exercise.

6
00:00:13,027 --> 00:00:15,535
 This is called naturalistic observation,

7
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:18,430
 observing people in their natural context.

8
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,110
 So I'm fortunate that I actually live across the street from a park, so

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,290
 I can sit here in my rocking chair on my porch and just watch people exercising.

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,540
 Now, I want to start with very specific observations and

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,190
 then generalize out to more abstract tasks.

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,790
 That way I'll observe something called confirmation bias which is

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,930
 basically when you see what you want to see, so what do I notice?

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,160
 Well, I notice that there's a lot of different types of exercisers.

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,870
 There are walkers, joggers, runners I see some rollerbladers,

16
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,030
 I see some people doing yoga.

17
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,180
 I see a lot of people riding bikes but

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,950
 the bikers seem to be broken into two different kinds of groups.

19
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,090
 I see a lot of people biking kind of leisurely but

20
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,220
 I also see some bikers who are a little bit more strenuous about it.

21
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,620
 I'm also noticing that while joggers might be able to stop and

22
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,300
 start pretty quickly, that's harder for someone riding a bike.

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,840
 So I might want to avoid designs that force the user to

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,960
 pull out their phone a lot because that's going to be dangerous and

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,280
 awkward for people riding bikes.

26
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,250
 Now I also see people exercising in groups and

27
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,230
 also people exercising individually.

28
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,870
 For those people exercising in groups,

29
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,910
 I don't actually know if they'd be interested in this.

30
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,909
 Listening to something might kind of defeat the purpose of

31
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:17,732
 exercising together.

32
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:20,057
 So I'm going to have to note that down as a question I want to ask

33
00:01:20,057 --> 00:01:21,450
 people later.

34
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,460
 I also see that many people tend to stretch before and

35
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,730
 after exercising and I'm wondering if we can use that.

36
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,140
 Then we can have some kind of starting and ending sequence for this, so

37
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,180
 that a single session is kind of book ending by both stretching, and

38
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,790
 interacting with our app.

39
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,526
 Note that by just watching people engage in the task of exercising,

40
00:01:36,526 --> 00:01:39,751
 I'm gathering an enormous amount of information that might affect my design.

41
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:43,101
 But note also, that while naturalistic observation is great,

42
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:45,220
 I'm limited ethically in what I can do.

43
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,620
 I can't interact with users directly and I can't capture identifying information

44
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,270
 like videos and photographs that's why I can't show you what I'm seeing out here.

45
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,890
 I'm also limited in that I don't know anything about what those users

46
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,920
 are thinking.

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,870
 I don't know if the people working out in groups would want to be

48
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,270
 able to listen to audiobooks while they're doing yoga.

49
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,330
 I don't know if bluetooth headsets would be problematic for

50
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,630
 people riding bike, I need to do a lot more before I get to the design phase.

51
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,110
 But this has been very informative in my understanding of the problem space and

52
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:10,110
 giving me things I can ask people later on.
