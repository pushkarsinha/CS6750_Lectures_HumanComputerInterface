1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,690
 Writing survey questions is an art, as well as a science.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,160
 So let's take a look at an intentionally poorly designed survey, and

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,450
 see everything we can find that's wrong with it.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,560
 So on the left is a survey.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,960
 It's kind of short, mostly because of screen real estate.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,750
 Write down in the box on the right everything that is wrong with

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,990
 this survey.

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,170
 Feel free to skip forward if you don't want to listen to me read

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,010
 out the questions.

10
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,920
 On a scale of 1 to 4 with 1 meaning a lot and

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,770
 4 meaning not at all, how much do you enjoy exercising?

12
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,370
 Why do you like to exercise?

13
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,040
 On a scale of 1 to 6 with 1 meaning not at all and

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,310
 6 meaning a lot, how much do you like audiobooks?

15
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:35,310
 Have you listened to an audiobook this year?
