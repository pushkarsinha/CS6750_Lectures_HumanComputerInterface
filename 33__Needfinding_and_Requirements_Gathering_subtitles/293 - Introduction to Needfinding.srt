1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:10,185
 The first stage of the design lifecycle is need-finding or requirements gathering.

2
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:13,965
 This is the stage where we go and try to find out what the user really needs.

3
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:16,590
 The biggest mistake that the designer can make is jumping to

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,190
 the design process before understanding the user or the task.

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,825
 We want to develop a deep understanding of the task they're trying to accomplish and why.

6
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,220
 As we do this,

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,700
 it's important to try to come in with as few preconceived notions as possible.

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,230
 There's an old adage that says,

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,880
 "When all you have is a hammer,

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,430
 everything looks like a nail." This is similar.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,790
 If you come in having already decided what approach you want to take,

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,425
 it's tempting to only see the problem in terms of the approach you've chosen.

13
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:44,840
 So, we're going to go through a process that attempts to avoid

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,285
 as many preconceived notions as possible.

15
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:50,630
 We're going to start by defining some general questions we want to answer

16
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,720
 throughout the data gathering process about who the user is,

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,580
 what they're doing, and what they need.

18
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,070
 Then, we'll go through several methods of generating answers to

19
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,940
 those questions to gain a better understanding of the user.

20
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,070
 Then, we'll talk about how to formalize the data we gather into

21
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,405
 a shareable model of the task and a list of requirements for our ultimate interface.

22
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:12,120
 Note that each of these tools could get a lesson on its own on how to do it.

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,180
 So, we'll try to provide some additional resources to read

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:14,180
 further on the tools you choose to use.
