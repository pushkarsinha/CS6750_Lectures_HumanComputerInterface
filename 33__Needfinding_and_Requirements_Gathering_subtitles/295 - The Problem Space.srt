00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,560
 In order to do some real need finding,

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,810
 the first thing we need to do is identify the problem space.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,300
 Where is the task occurring,

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:12,120
 what else is going on, what are the user's explicit and implicit needs?

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,060
 We'll talk about some of the methods for doing that in this lesson, but

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,400
 before we get into those methods,

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,630
 we want to understand the scope of the space we're looking at.

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,731
 So consider the difference between these two actions.

9
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:44,218
 [MUSIC]

10
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:48,600
 Notice that in each of these, I'm doing the same task, turning off the alarm.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,620
 But in the first scene we're focusing very narrowly on the interaction between

12
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,450
 the user and the interface.

13
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,440
 In the latter,

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,150
 we're taking into consideration a broader view of the problem space.

15
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,890
 We could zoom out even further if we wanted to and

16
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,180
 ask questions about Where and why people need alarm systems in the first place.

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,640
 That might lead us to designing things like security systems for

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,220
 dorm rooms or checking systems for office buildings.

19
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,950
 As we're going about need finding,

20
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,410
 we want to make sure we're taking the broad approach.

21
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,610
 Understanding the entire problem space in which we're interested,

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,170
 not just focusing narrowly on the user's interaction with a particular interface.

23
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,630
 So in our exploration of methods for need finding,

24
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,050
 we're going to start with the most authentic types of general observation,

25
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:28,050
 then move through progressively more targeted types of need finding.
