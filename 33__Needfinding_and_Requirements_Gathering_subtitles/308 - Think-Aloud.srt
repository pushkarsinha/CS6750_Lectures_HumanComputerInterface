00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,941
 Think-aloud protocols are similar to interviews in that we're asking users to

2
00:00:03,941 --> 00:00:05,905
 talk about their perceptions of the task.

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,889
 But with think-aloud, we're asking them to actually do so

4
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:10,242
 in the context of the task.

5
00:00:10,242 --> 00:00:13,634
 So instead of bringing Morgan in to answer some questions about listening to

6
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:16,443
 audiobooks while exercising, I'll ask her to actually think

7
00:00:16,443 --> 00:00:18,995
 out loud while listening to audiobooks and exercising.

8
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:21,139
 If this was a different task like something on a computer,

9
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:23,033
 I could have her just come into my lab and work on it.

10
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:26,238
 But since this is out in the world, what I might just do is give her a voice

11
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:29,561
 recorder to record her thoughts while she's out running and listening.

12
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:33,098
 Now think aloud is very useful, because it can help us get at users thoughts

13
00:00:33,098 --> 00:00:35,976
 that they forget when they are no longer engaged in the task.

14
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:39,796
 But it's also a bit dangerous by asking people to think aloud about their task,

15
00:00:39,796 --> 00:00:42,534
 we encourage them to think about it more deliberately and

16
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:45,120
 that can change the way they actually act.

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,930
 So while it's useful to get an understanding of what they are thinking,

18
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,540
 we should check to see if there are places where what they do differs when

19
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,080
 thinking out loud about it.

20
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,260
 We can do that with what's called a post-event protocol,

21
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,220
 which is largely the same, except we wait to get the user's

22
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,050
 thoughts until immediately after the activity.

23
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,590
 That way, the activity is still fresh in their minds, but

24
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:02,590
 the act of thinking about it shouldn't affect their performance quite as much.
