00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
 Here are five quick tips for conducting effective interviews.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,170
 Now, we recommend reading more about this before you actually start interviewing people,

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,700
 but these should get you started.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,900
 Number one, focus on the six W's when you're writing your questions,

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,100
 who, what, where, when, why, and how.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,315
 Try to avoid questions that lend themselves to one word or yes or no answers,

7
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:23,400
 those are better gathered via surveys.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,080
 Use your interview questions to ask open-ended semi-structured questions.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,975
 Number two, be aware of bias.

10
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:34,020
 Look at how you're phrasing your questions and interactions and

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,125
 make sure you're not predisposing the participant to certain views.

12
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:40,200
 If you only smile when they say what you want them to say, for example,

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,490
 your risk biasing them to agree with you.

14
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,230
 Number three, listen.

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,370
 Many novice interviewers get caught up in having a conversation with

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,220
 a participant rather than gathering data from the participant.

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,220
 Make sure the participant is doing the vast majority of

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,615
 the talking and don't reveal anything that might predispose them to agree with you.

19
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:01,885
 Number four, organize the interview.

20
00:01:01,885 --> 00:01:03,760
 Make sure to have an introduction phase,

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,920
 some lighter questions to build trust,

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,255
 and a summary at the end,

23
00:01:07,255 --> 00:01:09,970
 so the user understands the purpose of the questions.

24
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,600
 Be ready to push the interview forward or pull it back on track.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,510
 Number five, practice.

26
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,280
 Practice your questions on friends,

27
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,560
 family, or research partners in advance.

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,355
 Rehearse the entire interview.

29
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:23,880
 Gathering subjects is tough,

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,170
 so when you actually have them,

31
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:25,170
 you want to make sure to get the most out of them.
