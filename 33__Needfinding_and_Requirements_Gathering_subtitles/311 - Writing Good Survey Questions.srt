1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
 Surveys are used often in HCI because of their convenience,

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,275
 but they're only useful if the questions are actually well-written.

3
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:12,030
 Tips like "Be aware of bias" and "Test it out" are good pieces of general advice,

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,080
 but there are also lots of

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,140
 specific things that we can do to make our survey questions better.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,850
 So, in fact, there are six things I personally recommend in survey design: be clear,

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,219
 be concise, be specific,

8
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,105
 be expressive, be unbiased, and be usable.

9
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:29,565
 Let's go through what these actually mean in practice.

10
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:34,190
 Be clear means we want to make sure the user actually understands what we're asking.

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,000
 So, if we're using a numeric scale,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,750
 for example, we don't want to just give them numbers.

13
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,660
 We want to actually code those numbers with what they mean.

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,880
 It's not uncommon to see some larger scales code only the first,

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,310
 last, and middle number,

16
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,640
 but it's always better to assign some kind of label to every single number,

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,245
 and make sure they're parallel.

18
00:00:51,245 --> 00:00:53,900
 We wouldn't want some thing like highly dissatisfied,

19
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,565
 dissatisfied, neutral, a little satisfied, and satisfied.

20
00:00:57,565 --> 00:01:02,195
 We also want to avoid overlapping ranges if we're asking about some range of numbers.

21
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,480
 So, here we're asking, "How many times per week do you watch Hulu?"

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,555
 So, if a user says they generally watch twice per week,

23
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:12,055
 it's not clear whether they would choose 0-2 or 2-5.

24
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:14,980
 Instead, we want to make sure the ranges don't overlap.

25
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,550
 If we're in doubt on whether the user will actually understand our question,

26
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,050
 we should provide some extra detail.

27
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,490
 For example, if we were asking,

28
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,810
 "Do you own a tablet computer?"

29
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:27,310
 We might infer that not all our users really understand what a tablet computer is.

30
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,490
 So, we'd go on to define and say it's

31
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,050
 a computer with a touchscreen and detachable keyboard.

32
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,770
 That improves the likelihood that the user actually understands what we're asking.

33
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,960
 If we're asking about a frequency,

34
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,550
 it's useful to timebox it.

35
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,370
 So, for example, if we ask,

36
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,395
 "How often do you exercise?"

37
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,550
 Users might not fully understand what the difference

38
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,115
 between rarely and occasionally is, for example.

39
00:01:48,115 --> 00:01:49,750
 Is rarely once a week,

40
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,430
 once a month, once a year?

41
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,190
 Is frequently everyday, five times a week?

42
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,540
 So, instead, we probably want to ask a question like,

43
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,340
 "In the past seven days,

44
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,425
 how many times have you done this behavior?"

45
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:03,800
 That's a much more objective question and a lot easier to answer.

46
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,165
 Second, we want to be concise with our questions.

47
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:09,260
 We always want to make sure to ask our questions in

48
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,150
 plain language that the user can understand.

49
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,045
 So, for example, instead of asking something like,

50
00:02:14,045 --> 00:02:16,100
 "What was the overall level of cleanliness that

51
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,395
 you observed within the car that you rented?"

52
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:20,850
 We'd ask, "How clean was the car?"

53
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,700
 Now, it is worth noting that sometimes being concise and being clear are at odds.

54
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,330
 Adding more detail inherently means being less concise.

55
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,190
 So, it's a trade-off.

56
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,090
 Use your best judgment to decide when adding more detail will be worth the trade-off.

57
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,680
 Third, when asking questions,

58
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,284
 we want to be specific.

59
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:41,765
 We want to avoid questions that are on super-big ideas.

60
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:44,725
 For example, "How satisfied were you with the interface?"

61
00:02:44,725 --> 00:02:48,140
 Well, there's a lot of elements of satisfaction with using an interface.

62
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,030
 Asking about satisfaction with the interface as

63
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,940
 a whole is such a big question that it's hard to answer.

64
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,950
 Instead, we might ask a series of

65
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,160
 smaller questions like how satisfied were you with how quickly

66
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,950
 the interface responded to your commands or how

67
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,415
 satisfied were you with how easily you could find the command you were looking for.

68
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:07,955
 Part of this is avoiding what are called double-barrel questions.

69
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:12,290
 A double-barrel question is a question that asks about two things at the same time.

70
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,270
 So, for example, if we were asked,

71
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,190
 "How satisfied are you with the speed and availability of your mobile connection?

72
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,520
 What if a user were satisfied with the availability,

73
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,080
 but not satisfied with the speed?"

74
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,475
 How did they answer that question?

75
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:25,845
 So, instead, we will break this up into two questions,

76
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:27,225
 one asking about speed,

77
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:29,000
 one asking about availability.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,345
 We also want to avoid questions that allows some internal conflict.

79
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,275
 This is similar to avoiding questions about big ideas.

80
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:37,815
 For example, how satisfied were you with your food?

81
00:03:37,815 --> 00:03:40,280
 Well, I might have been satisfied with the taste of it,

82
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,750
 but not with the temperature of it or not the appearance of it.

83
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,560
 So, instead, we break that down into smaller questions that each

84
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,700
 address each individual component of satisfaction.

85
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,680
 Four, we want to be expressive or really what they

86
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,440
 should say is allow the user to be expressive,

87
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,755
 but that would break my nice little symmetry over here.

88
00:03:56,755 --> 00:04:00,095
 We want to make sure to emphasize the user's opinions.

89
00:04:00,095 --> 00:04:04,850
 Sometimes users taking our surveys are hesitant to be very emphatic or very critical.

90
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,100
 So, we want to make sure to emphasize in

91
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,590
 the questions that we're looking for their opinions.

92
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,400
 Instead of asking, "Is our subscription price too high?"

93
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,260
 We might ask, "Do you feel our subscription price is too high,

94
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,015
 too low, or about right?"

95
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:20,070
 In the second version, a user could say too

96
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,419
 high without feeling like they're being very combative.

97
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:27,800
 Whenever possible, we want to use ranges instead of yes and no questions.

98
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,030
 That allows the user to express more of the details about their individual answers.

99
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,140
 So, instead of asking,

100
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,495
 "Do you use social media? Yes or no?"

101
00:04:35,495 --> 00:04:37,670
 We might ask, "In the past seven days,

102
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,610
 how much time have you spent on social media?"

103
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,770
 This allows the user to express something more closely

104
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,350
 resembling the complexity of their answer.

105
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,889
 If we're asking about something with levels of frequency or levels of agreement,

106
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,540
 we want to give lots of levels.

107
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,980
 Simply saying how satisfied are you, dissatisfied,

108
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,975
 or satisfied isn't enough to capture the full range of user opinions.

109
00:04:56,975 --> 00:04:59,610
 I generally recommend always using at least five,

110
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,345
 so you can differentiate people who are highly satisfied,

111
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:05,765
 which means I have no complaints from people who are satisfied,

112
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:07,640
 which means I might have some complaints,

113
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,725
 but overall, it's a positive experience.

114
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:12,275
 That's actually a pretty useful distinction to arrive at.

115
00:05:12,275 --> 00:05:16,760
 When possible, it's also useful to allow users to make multiple selections.

116
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,625
 For example, imagine we were asking,

117
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,420
 "What social media platform do you use the most?"

118
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,990
 Then we're losing something with those users who think

119
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,210
 they use multiple platforms with equal frequency.

120
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,960
 So, instead, why not let them choose more than one?

121
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,640
 There might be some good reason why we want them to choose only one,

122
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,800
 maybe some follow-up questions are based on that,

123
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,895
 but a lot of times it may also be beneficial to allow them to select multiple answers.

124
00:05:37,895 --> 00:05:40,370
 For questions that are nominal or categorical,

125
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,310
 it's often good to let them add new categories.

126
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,800
 So, instead of just giving them six to choose from,

127
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,330
 we could give them six to choose from,

128
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,720
 but also a box to put in another one.

129
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,330
 That allows them to express ideas that we didn't anticipate.

130
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,890
 My fifth piece of advice is to be unbiased or to avoid bias wherever possible,

131
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,740
 and that last question is actually a good example of that as well.

132
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,915
 If we don't give them that other box,

133
00:06:02,915 --> 00:06:06,790
 then we're biasing them with only our pre-established selections.

134
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,115
 Now, sometimes that's okay.

135
00:06:08,115 --> 00:06:10,010
 If we've done a lot of surveys in the past and found that

136
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,280
 these are the only answers anyone ever puts in,

137
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,930
 then it's okay to limit the space to only those.

138
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,220
 Just remember, if you provide users categories and don't give them another box,

139
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,375
 then you might be biasing them towards only those opinions that you anticipated.

140
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,595
 But even if you provide another box,

141
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:27,275
 you still risk some bias.

142
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:29,150
 So, for example, if you ask,

143
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,060
 "Why did you choose our service over our competitors?"

144
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,340
 A user might look at these options and say, "Well,

145
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,435
 now that you mention it,

146
00:06:35,435 --> 00:06:37,805
 I guess it was because of your good reputation."

147
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:40,520
 But if you ask them this question without giving them options,

148
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,050
 they may have given a different answer.

149
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,155
 It was the act of reading these options that made them think,

150
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,865
 "Maybe that's why I did that."

151
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:51,470
 So, often it's good to actually leave these potentially open-ended questions open.

152
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,205
 Let them just say in free text why they chose your service.

153
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:56,960
 Now, again, if you've done the survey for

154
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,090
 awhile and have a lot of these open-ended responses,

155
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,140
 and you found that there's only really four or five answers that users ever put in,

156
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,425
 then it's okay to distill those down to options.

157
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,060
 In that case, you've done enough data analysis

158
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,880
 to understand that these are really the only selections.

159
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,330
 But if you aren't yet sure the full space of answers you might receive,

160
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,145
 it can be better to leave it open-ended.

161
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:18,590
 We also need to avoid leading questions.

162
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,120
 This one is a little bit more obvious.

163
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,655
 If we're asking for opinions on our new interface,

164
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:23,690
 we don't want to say something like,

165
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,985
 "Did our brand new AI-based interface generate better recommendations? Yes or no?"

166
00:07:27,985 --> 00:07:30,710
 Obviously, here we want the user to choose yes.

167
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,260
 Instead, we should ask it in a more neutral fashion.

168
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,240
 "How satisfied were you with the recommendations the interface generated?"

169
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,125
 Similarly, we want to avoid loaded questions.

170
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,020
 For example, "In the past seven days,

171
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,720
 how much time have you wasted on social media?"

172
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,100
 Asking the question like that is guaranteed to lower our estimates,

173
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,750
 compared to, "In the past seven days,

174
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,280
 how much time have you spent on social media?"

175
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,090
 Finally, my last word of advice is to make your survey usable.

176
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,100
 Now, a lot of this is actually going to come down to

177
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,210
 the details of the survey platform that you choose,

178
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,890
 but some of these are decisions that you can make as well.

179
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,890
 For example, it's always good to provide a progress bar that lets the user know how

180
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,820
 far along in the survey they actually are and adjust their expectations accordingly.

181
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,530
 It's not uncommon for users to quit

182
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,085
 surveys because they don't know how close they were to the end,

183
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:16,365
 even though in reality,

184
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:18,935
 they were only a few seconds away from the last question.

185
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:20,270
 Along the same line,

186
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,520
 it's good to make your page links consistent.

187
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,290
 If you have a five-page survey,

188
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,000
 you don't want one question on the first page,

189
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,170
 and 50 on the second page,

190
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,555
 and two on the third page.

191
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:31,190
 If a user opens a second page and sees 50 questions,

192
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,520
 they're going to naturally assume that the remaining pages also have 50 questions.

193
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,515
 So, try to make them consistent to set

194
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:39,340
 accurate expectations about how long the survey is going to take.

195
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,400
 Third, order your questions logically.

196
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,780
 There should be some natural flow to the order in which you ask different questions.

197
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,960
 You don't want to go from a demographic question to a satisfaction question,

198
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,460
 back to a demographic question.

199
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,180
 You want to gather your questions into topics.

200
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,320
 Ideally, they should take the user along

201
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,980
 the thought process that you want them to engage in while answering your questions.

202
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,780
 Fourth, at the end of the survey,

203
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,695
 it's good to alert users about unanswered questions.

204
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:06,030
 On the one hand, maybe the user didn't know they skipped the question.

205
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,465
 This lets them know, so they can go back and answer.

206
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:12,019
 But on the other hand, maybe they skipped that question intentionally,

207
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,460
 maybe they weren't comfortable answering,

208
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,600
 maybe they just don't have an answer,

209
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,755
 maybe your space of answer options didn't capture what they thought.

210
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:20,510
 So, you don't want to force them to go back and answer it,

211
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,080
 but you also want to account for times when they may have accidentally skipped it.

212
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,685
 So, let them know,

213
00:09:25,685 --> 00:09:27,425
 but don't force them to go back.

214
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:31,700
 Finally, preview the survey yourself. This takes some discipline.

215
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,760
 I have lots of surveys that I never previewed and later found out I

216
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,945
 use check mark boxes instead of radio buttons for a particular question.

217
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:39,620
 So, force yourself to actually preview

218
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,410
 the survey and fill it out as if you were a real user.

219
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,880
 Don't just scroll through it,

220
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,235
 actually go through and answer each question.

221
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:48,140
 So, that was quite a lot of information,

222
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,120
 but I'm hoping the fact that most of the tips were pretty

223
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,625
 practical will make it easy to apply.

224
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,155
 When in doubt, remember,

225
00:09:54,155 --> 00:09:56,240
 you can always ask for feedback on your survey

226
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,240
 questions before sending it out to actual participants.
