1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,714
 Personally, I think three of these are good questions.

2
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:06,134
 Do you exercise, is not a great question, because it's kind of a yes or

3
00:00:06,134 --> 00:00:07,540
 no question.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,640
 How often do you exercise,

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,946
 is actually the better way of asking the same question.

6
00:00:10,946 --> 00:00:15,490
 It's subsumes all the answers to do you exercise, but leaves more room for

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,080
 elaboration or more room for detail.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,000
 Do you exercise for health or for pleasure, is not a great question,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,670
 because it presents to the user a dichotomy.

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,270
 It might not be the way they actually think about the problem.

11
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,899
 Maybe there's some other reason they exercise.

12
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,280
 Maybe they do it to be social, for example.

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,690
 We want to leave open all the possibilities a user might have.

14
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,173
 So instead of asking, do you exercise for health or

15
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:39,199
 for pleasure, we probably want to ask, why do you exercise?

16
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:42,681
 The next two questions work pretty well, because they leave plenty of room for

17
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:45,001
 the participant to have a wide range of answers, and

18
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:47,850
 they're not leading them towards any particular answer.

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,030
 We're not asking, for example, what smartphone do you use to listen to

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,640
 something, because maybe they don't use a smartphone.

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,220
 This sixth one is interesting.

22
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,570
 We're developing an app for listening to audiobooks while exercising.

23
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,290
 Would that be interesting to you?

24
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,890
 What's wrong with that question?

25
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,170
 When we say, we're developing an app,

26
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,250
 we introduce something called social desirability bias.

27
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,321
 Because we're the ones developing the app,

28
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:12,932
 the user is going to feel some pressure to agree with us, to support our ideas.

29
00:01:12,932 --> 00:01:14,412
 People like to support one another.

30
00:01:14,412 --> 00:01:17,454
 And so even if they wouldn't be interested, they'll likely

31
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:20,905
 say that they would, because that's the supportive thing to say.

32
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:24,465
 No one wants to say, hey, great idea, David, but I would never use it.

33
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:27,910
 So what we want to make sure to do is create no incentive for

34
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,080
 a user to not give us the complete, honest answer.

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,870
 Worrying about hurting our feelings is one reason

36
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,780
 why they wouldn't be totally honest.

37
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,520
 So we might reword this question just to say, would you be interested in an app

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,250
 for listening to audiobooks while exercising?

39
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,620
 Now granted, the fact that we're the ones asking still probably will tip off

40
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,260
 the user that we're probably thinking about moving in that direction, but

41
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,050
 at least it's going to be a little more collaborative.

42
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,630
 We're not tipping them off that we're already planning to do this,

43
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,440
 we're telling them that we might be thinking about doing it.

44
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,500
 And so if they don't think it's a good idea, they kind of feel like they should

45
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,100
 tell us right now, to save us time down the road.

46
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,850
 So by rephrasing the question that way, we hopefully,

47
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:05,850
 avoid biasing the participant to just agree with us to be nice.
