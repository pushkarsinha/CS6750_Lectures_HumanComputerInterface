00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,810
 Here are five quick tips for doing naturalistic observation.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,480
 Number one, take notes.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,565
 Don't just sit around watching for a while.

4
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:16,215
 Be prepared to gather targeted information and observations about what you see.

5
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:20,625
 Number two, start specific, and then abstract.

6
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:23,010
 Right down the individual little actions you see people

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,635
 doing before trying to interpret or summarize them.

8
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:27,720
 If you jump to summarizing too soon,

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,475
 you risk tunnel vision.

10
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:32,640
 Number three, spread out your sessions.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,530
 Rather than sitting somewhere for two hours,

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,805
 one day and then moving on,

13
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:39,735
 try to observe in shorter 10 to 15 minute sessions several times.

14
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:42,275
 You may find interesting different information,

15
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,540
 and your growing understanding and reflection on

16
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,810
 past exercises will inform your future sessions.

17
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,120
 Number four, find the partner.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,385
 Observe together with someone else.

19
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,035
 Take your own notes, and then compare them later.

20
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:58,970
 So, you can see if you all interpreted the same scenarios or actions in the same way.

21
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,050
 Number five, look for questions.

22
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,210
 Naturalistic observation should inform the questions you decide to

23
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,710
 ask participants in more targeted need-finding exercises.

24
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,660
 You don't need to have all the answers based on observation alone.

25
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:11,660
 What you need is questions to investigate further.
