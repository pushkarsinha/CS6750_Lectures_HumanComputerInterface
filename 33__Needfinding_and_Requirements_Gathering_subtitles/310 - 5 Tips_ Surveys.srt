 Survey design is a well documented art form.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,980
 In fact, designing surveys is very similar to designing interfaces themselves.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,460
 So, many of the lessons we've learned in our conversations apply here as well.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,585
 Here are five quick tips for designing and administering effective surveys.

5
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:21,465
 Number one, less is more.

6
00:00:21,465 --> 00:00:26,040
 The biggest mistake that I see novice survey designers make is to ask way too much.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,420
 That affects the response rate and the reliability of the data.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,080
 Ask the minimum number of questions necessary to get the data that you need,

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,140
 and only ask questions that you know that you'll use.

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,305
 Number two, be aware of bias.

11
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:41,150
 Look at how you're phrasing the questions.

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,485
 Are there positive or negative connotations?

13
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:47,225
 Are participants implicitly pressured to answer one way or the other?

14
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:50,480
 Number three, tie them to the inventory.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,250
 Make sure every question on

16
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,280
 your survey connects to some of the data that you want to gather.

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,865
 Start with the goals for the survey and write the questions from there.

18
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:01,745
 Number four, test it out.

19
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:03,995
 Before sending it to real participants,

20
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:06,755
 have your co-workers or colleagues test out your survey.

21
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:08,900
 Pretend they're real users and see if you would

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,585
 get the data you need from their responses.

23
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:14,285
 Number five, iterate.

24
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:17,075
 Survey design is like interface design.

25
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:19,790
 Test out your survey, see what works and what doesn't,

26
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,365
 and revise it accordingly.

27
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:23,930
 Give participants a chance to give feedback on the survey

28
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:23,930
 itself so that you can improve it for future iterations.
