1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
 Now that you have some understanding of the user's needs,

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,435
 it's time to try to formalize that into something we can use in design.

3
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:09,105
 There are a number of different ways we can do this.

4
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:10,830
 For example, maybe we create

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,340
 a step-by-step task outline of the user engaging in some task.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,070
 We can break those tasks down into sub-tasks as well,

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,780
 all the way down to the operator level.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,745
 We can further develop this kind of task outline into a hierarchical network,

9
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:24,170
 like we talked about before.

10
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,305
 This might involve more complexity than simply a linear series of actions.

11
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:30,870
 We might further augment this with a diagram of

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,220
 the structural relationships amongst the components in the system and how they interact.

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,000
 This might give us some information about how we get feedback back to

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,170
 the user or how they interact with our interface in the first place.

15
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,730
 From there, we might develop as even more into

16
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,555
 a flowchart equipped with decision-making points or points of interruptions.

17
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:51,260
 Notice how these representations are very similar to the outcomes of

18
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,450
 the task analyses and we talk about in the principles unit of our conversations.

19
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,300
 We can similarly use the data gathered from here to summarize

20
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,880
 a more comprehensive task analysis that will be

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:01,880
 useful in designing and prototyping our designs.
