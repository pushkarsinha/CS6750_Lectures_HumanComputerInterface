1
00:00:00,458 --> 00:00:02,110
 During these need-finding exercises,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,520
 you'll have gathered an enormous amount of information about your users.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,210
 Ideally, you've combined different sets of these approaches.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,360
 You've observed people performing the tasks,

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,400
 you've asked them about their thought process, and you tried it some yourself.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,408
 Pay special attention to some of the places where the data seem to conflict.

7
00:00:18,408 --> 00:00:21,670
 Are these cases where you as the designer understand some elements of

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,620
 the task that the users don't?

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,740
 Or are these cases where your expertise hasn't quite developed to the point of

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,680
 understanding the task?

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,990
 Once you've gone through the data gathering process,

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,800
 it's time to revisit that inventory of things we wanted to gather initially.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,630
 One, who are the users?

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,600
 Two, where are the users?

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,530
 Three, what is the context of the task?

16
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,630
 Four, what are their goals?

17
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,840
 Five, right now, what do they need?

18
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,890
 Six, what are their tasks?

19
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,510
 And seven, what are the subtasks?

20
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,510
 Revisit these, with the results of your data gathering in mind.
