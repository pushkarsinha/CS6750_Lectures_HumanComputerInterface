00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,700
 Interviews are likely to be one of the most common ways you gather data.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,150
 So let's run through some good and bad interview questions real quick.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,790
 So here are six questions.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,520
 Which of these would make good interview questions?

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,823
 Mark the ones that would be good.

6
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:15,502
 For the ones that would be bad,

7
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:19,191
 briefly brainstorm a way to rewrite the question to make it better.

8
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:21,791
 You can go ahead and skip forward to the exercise if you don't want to listen to

9
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,240
 me read them out.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,320
 Number one, do you exercise?

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,300
 Number two, how often do you exercise?

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,280
 Number three, do you exercise for health or for pleasure?

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,790
 Number four, what, if anything do you listen to while exercising?

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,390
 Number five, what device do you use to listen to something while exercising?

15
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,060
 Number six, we're developing an app for

16
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,560
 listening to audio books while exercising.

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:46,560
 Would that be interesting to you?
