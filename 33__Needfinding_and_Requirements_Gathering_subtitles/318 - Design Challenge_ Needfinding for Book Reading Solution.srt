1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,360
 We could apply pretty much every single need-finding method that we've discussed

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,720
 to this task.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,950
 We could, for example, go to the library and just watch people reading and

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,850
 see how they're taking notes.

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,360
 We've all likely done it ourselves.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,690
 We can reflect on what we do while reading, although again,

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,680
 we need to be careful not to over-value our own priorities and approaches.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,490
 Reading is common enough, that we can easily find participants for

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,620
 interviews, surveys, think alouds.

10
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,450
 The challenge here will be deciding who our users really are.

11
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,640
 Books are ubiquitous.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,860
 Are we trying to cater to everyone who reads deliberately?

13
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,200
 If so, we need to sample a wide range of users or initially,

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,740
 we could choose a subset.

15
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,870
 We might cater to students who are studying or busy business people, or

16
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,580
 people that specifically walk or bike to work.

17
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,280
 We might start with one of those groups and then abstract out over time.

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,980
 We might eventually abstract all the way to just anyone who's unable to read and

19
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,670
 take notes the traditional way like people driving cars or

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,970
 people with visual impairments but that's further down the road.

21
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,300
 The more important thing is that we define who our user is,

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,850
 define the task in which we're interested, and deliberately design for

23
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:03,850
 that user and that task through out the design life cycle.
