1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,029
 The needfinding exercises that we've gone through so

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:05,020
 far focus on the needs of the exercisers.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,180
 What can they do with their hands,

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,600
 what is the environment around them like while exercising, and so on?

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,660
 However, that's only half the picture for this particular design.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,620
 Our ultimate goal is to bring the experience of consuming books

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,340
 to people that exercise,

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,270
 which means we also need to understand the task of book-reading on its own.

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,850
 Now a problem space is still around exercisers, so

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,110
 we wouldn't go through the entire design life cycle for book reading on its own.

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,770
 We don't need to design or prototype anything for them.

12
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,390
 But if we're going to bring the full book reading experience to people while

13
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,650
 exercising, we need to understand what that is.

14
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,340
 So take a moment and design an approach to needfinding for

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:38,340
 people who are reading on their own.
