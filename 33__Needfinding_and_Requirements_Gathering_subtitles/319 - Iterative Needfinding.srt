1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,040
 We've noted that design is a life cycle from needfinding to brainstorming design

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,730
 alternatives to prototyping to evaluation.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,520
 And then, back to needfinding to continue the cycle again.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,180
 Needfinding on it's own though can be a cycle by itself.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,640
 For example, we might use the results of our naturalistic observation

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,630
 to inform the questions we asked during our interviews.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,060
 For example, imagine that we noticed that very many joggers,

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,040
 jog with only one earphone in.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,462
 That's a naturalistic observation, and then in an interview, we might ask,

10
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:31,104
 why do some of you jog with only one earphone in?

11
00:00:31,104 --> 00:00:34,088
 And we might get the answer from the interview that it's to listen for

12
00:00:34,088 --> 00:00:34,860
 cars or listen for

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,010
 someone trying to get their attention because they exercise in a busy area.

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,970
 Now that we understand why they have that behavior, maybe we develop a survey

15
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,460
 to try and see how widespread that behavior is, and ask, how many

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,430
 of you need to worry about what's around you when you're listening while driving?

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,100
 If we notice in those surveys a significant split in the number of

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,830
 people who were concerned about that,

19
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,560
 that might inform our next round of naturalistic observation.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,790
 We might go out and look and see in what environments are people only wearing

21
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,900
 one headphone and in what environments are they wearing both.

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,010
 So in that way all of the different kinds of need finding that we do

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,490
 can inform our next round of other kinds of need finding.

24
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,300
 We can go through entire cycles just of need finding

25
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,270
 without ever going on to our design alternatives or prototyping stages.

26
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,530
 However, the prototyping and

27
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,220
 evaluation that we do will then become another input into this.

28
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,450
 During our evaluation we might discover things that will then inform

29
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,810
 what we need to do next as far as need finding is concerned.

30
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,860
 Creating prototypes and evaluating them gives us data on what works and

31
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,790
 what doesn't.

32
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,920
 And that might inform what we want to observe to better understand the task

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,530
 going forward.

34
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,330
 That's the reason why the output of evaluation is more needfinding.

35
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,020
 It would be a mistake to do one initial needfinding stage, and

36
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,020
 then jump in to a back and forth cycle of prototyping and evaluation.
