1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,360
 Before we start our need-finding exercises, we also want to enter with

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,060
 some understanding of the data we want to gather.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,020
 These are the questions we ultimately want to answer.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,160
 That's not to say we should be answering them every step of the way, but rather,

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,290
 we want to gather the data necessary to come to a conclusion at the end.

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,320
 Now, there are lots of inventories of the types of data you could gather, but

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,210
 here's one useful list.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,010
 One, who are the users?

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,150
 What are their ages, genders, levels of expertise?

10
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,220
 Two, where are the users?

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,260
 What is there environment?

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,880
 Number three, what is the context of the task?

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,010
 What else is competing for users' attention?

14
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,660
 Four, what are their goals?

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,350
 What are they trying to accomplish?

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,220
 Five, right now, what do they need?

17
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,730
 What are the physical objects?

18
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,900
 What information do they need?

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,160
 What collaborators do they need?

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,050
 Six, what are their tasks?

21
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,750
 What are they doing physically, cognitively, socially?

22
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,350
 And seven, what are the subtasks?

23
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,410
 How do they accomplish those subtasks?

24
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,570
 When you're designing your need finding methods,

25
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:00,570
 each thing you do should match up with one or more of these questions.
