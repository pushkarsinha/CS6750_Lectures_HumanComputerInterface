1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,390
 Just as we want to get an idea of the physical space of the problem,

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,150
 we also want to get an idea of the space of the user.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,190
 In other words, we want to understand who we're designing for.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,330
 That comes up a lot when doing design alternatives and prototyping,

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,490
 but we also want to make sure to gather information about

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,920
 the full range of users for whom we're designing.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,215
 So, let's take the example of designing an audiobook app for people that exercise.

8
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:24,320
 Am I interested in audiobooks just for kids or for adults too?

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,690
 Am I interested in experts who are exercising or novices at it?

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,090
 Am I interested in experts listening to audiobooks?

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,160
 Or am I interested in novices at that as well?

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,950
 Those are pretty key questions.

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,560
 They differentiate whether I'm designing for business people who want to be able to

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,030
 exercise while reading or

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,030
 exercisers who want to be able to do something else while exercising.

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,815
 The task is similar for both,

17
00:00:43,815 --> 00:00:45,779
 but the audience, their motivations,

18
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,400
 and their needs are different.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,060
 So, I need to identify these different types of users and

20
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,790
 perform need-finding exercises on all of them.

21
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,440
 One of the most successful products of all times

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,990
 exceeded because of the tension to user types.

23
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,510
 The Sony Walkman became such a dramatic success because

24
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,510
 they identified different needs for different types of people,

25
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,080
 design their product in a way that it met all those needs,

26
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,705
 but then they marketed specifically to those different types of individuals.

27
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:10,340
 You can read more about that in a book called

28
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:10,340
 Doing Cultural Studies by Hugh Mackay and Linda Janes.
