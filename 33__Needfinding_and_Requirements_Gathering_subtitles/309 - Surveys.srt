1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,030
 Most of the other methods for need finding, like observation, interviewing,

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,760
 apprenticeship, require a significant amount of effort for

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,630
 what is often relatively little data.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,380
 Or it's data from a small number of users.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,620
 We might spend an entire hour interviewing a single possible user or

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,440
 an hour observing a small number of users in the world.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,840
 The data we get from those interactions is deep and thorough, but sometimes,

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,860
 we also want broader data.

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,210
 Sometimes, we just want to know how many people encounter a certain difficulty or

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,030
 engage in a certain task.

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,910
 If we're designing an audio book app for exercisers, for example.

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,805
 Maybe we just want to know how often those people exercises or

13
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:38,110
 maybe we want to know what kind of books they listen to.

14
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,370
 At that point, a survey might be our more appropriate means of need finding.

15
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,640
 Surveys let us get a much larger number of responses very quickly and

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,390
 the questions can be phrased objectively,

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,550
 allowing for quicker interpretation.

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,490
 And plus, with the Internet, they can be administered asynchronously for

19
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,270
 at a pretty low cost.

20
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,660
 A few weeks ago, for example, I came up with the idea for

21
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,800
 a study on Friday morning.

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,620
 And with the great cooperation from our local IRB office, I was able to send out

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,370
 the survey to potential participants less than 24 hours later and

24
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,030
 receive 150 responses within a week.

25
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,290
 Now of course, the data I receive from that isn't nearly as thorough as what I

26
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,810
 would receive from interviewing some of those participants.

27
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,770
 But it's a powerful way of getting a larger amount of data.

28
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,890
 And it can be especially useful to decide what to ask participants

29
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:19,890
 during interviews or during focus groups.
