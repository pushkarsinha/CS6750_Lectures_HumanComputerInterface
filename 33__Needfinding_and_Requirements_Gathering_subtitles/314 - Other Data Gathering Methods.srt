00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,070
 So far we've discussed some of the more common approaches that need finding.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,890
 Depending on your domain though, there might be some other things you can do.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,214
 First, if you're designing for a task for which interfaces already exist,

4
00:00:11,214 --> 00:00:14,436
 you might start by critiquing the interfaces that already exist using some

5
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:17,777
 of the evaluation methods that we'll cover later in the evaluation lesson.

6
00:00:17,777 --> 00:00:21,562
 For example, if you're wanting to design a new system for ordering takeout food,

7
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:24,211
 you might evaluate the interfaces of calling in an order,

8
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:26,666
 ordering via mobile phone or ordering via a website.

9
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:30,392
 Second and similarly, [SOUND] if you're trying to develop a tool to address

10
00:00:30,392 --> 00:00:34,178
 a problem that people that are already addressing, you might go look at user

11
00:00:34,178 --> 00:00:38,164
 reviews and see what people already like and dislike about existing products.

12
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:41,360
 For example, there are dozens of alarm clock apps out there, and

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,960
 thousands of reviews.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,870
 If you want to design a new one, you could start there to find out

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,830
 what people need or what their common complaints are.

16
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,030
 Third, if you're working on a task that already involves a lot of automatic

17
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,960
 logging like web surfing, you could try to get some logs of user interaction

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,590
 that have already been generated.

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,140
 For example, say you wanted to build a browser that's better at

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,830
 anticipating what the user will want to open next.

21
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,010
 You could grab datalogs and look for trends both within and across users.

22
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,260
 You can creative with your data gathering methods.

23
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,280
 The goal is to use a variety of methods to paint a complete picture

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,280
 of the user's task.
