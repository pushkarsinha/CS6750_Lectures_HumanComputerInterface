00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:03,480
 Here are a few of the problems that I intentionally put into this survey.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,174
 Some of them are kind of obvious, but hopefully a couple others were a little

3
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:08,510
 bit more subtle and a little bit more interesting.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,490
 First when I say on a scale of one to four with one meaning a lot and

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,920
 four meaning not at all, what do two and three mean exactly?

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,280
 It's not a very clear scale to just say the endpoint.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,180
 Just giving the endpoints doesn't give a very clear scale.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,190
 We usually also want to provide an odd number of options, so

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,740
 that users have kind of a neutral central option.

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,000
 Sometimes we'll want to force our participants to take one side or

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,810
 the other, but generally we want to give them that middle neutral option.

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,820
 Either way though, we definitely don't want to change the number of options

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,520
 between those two questions.

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,300
 Having one be 1 to 4 and the other be 1 to 6 is just confusing.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,080
 And even worse, notice that we're reversing the scale between these two.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,399
 In the first question, the low number means a lot.

17
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,180
 In the second question, the high number means a lot.

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,930
 That's just terrible design.

19
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,560
 We want to be consistent across our entire survey,

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,490
 both with the direction of our scale and

21
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,410
 the number of options unless there's a compelling reason not to.

22
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,220
 The second question is also guilty of being quite a leading question.

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,695
 Why do you like to exercise assumes the participant likes to exercise.

24
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:10,980
 What are they supposed to say if they don't?

25
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,700
 And finally, the last question is a yes or no question.

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,730
 Have you listened to an audiobook this year?

27
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:16,860
 Yes or no.

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,770
 No is kind of an interesting answer, but yes, I don't know if you

29
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,940
 listened to one audiobook this year or a 100 audiobooks this year.

30
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,020
 I don't know if you listened every single day or

31
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,230
 if you just listened once because you had a gift certificate.

32
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,760
 So we want to reword this question to be a little more open-ended and

33
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:31,760
 support a wider range of participant answers.
