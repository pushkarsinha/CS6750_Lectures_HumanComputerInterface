00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,420
 In this unit, we've discussed the HCI research methods that formed the design life cycle,

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,944
 an iterative process between need-finding,

3
00:00:12,944 --> 00:00:15,750
 brainstorming design alternatives, prototyping,

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,045
 and evaluation with real users.

5
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:21,900
 We've also discussed the ethics behind this kind of research and how

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,725
 it applies to some more modern agile software development methodologies.

7
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,225
 Now, in this wrap-up lesson,

8
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:30,840
 we want to explore a couple of examples of the full design life cycle in action.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,470
 We also want to tie into the design principles unit and

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,580
 explore how we can use

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:35,580
 the design principles and research methods in conjunction with one another.
