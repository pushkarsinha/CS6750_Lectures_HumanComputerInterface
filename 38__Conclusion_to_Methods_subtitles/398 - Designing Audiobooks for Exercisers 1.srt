00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,830
 Throughout this unit, we've used

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,890
 the running example of designing an audio book app that would let

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,200
 people who are exercising interact with books and

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,050
 all the ways you or I might while we're sitting and reading.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,179
 That means being able to leave bookmarks,

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,845
 take notes, and so on.

7
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:16,710
 We discussed two in our foundational needfinding,

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,905
 going to a park and observing people exercising.

9
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:23,115
 We've talked also about doing interviews and surveys to find out

10
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:26,760
 more targeted information about what people wanted and needed.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,900
 Then based on that, we brainstormed a whole lot of alternatives.

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,930
 We thought about those alternatives in terms of different scenarios

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,860
 and personas to settle on those with the most potential.

14
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,385
 Then, we took those alternatives and we prototyped a few of them.

15
00:00:40,385 --> 00:00:44,750
 Specifically, we constructed Wizard of Oz prototypes for voice and gesture interfaces,

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,740
 and paper prototypes for on-screen interfaces.

17
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,100
 Then, we put those in front of our users.

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,810
 Well, a user in my case,

19
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,190
 but you would use more users.

20
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,290
 We got some initial feedback.

21
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,370
 So, at the end of one iteration of the design life-cycle,

22
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,135
 we have three different low-fidelity prototypes,

23
00:01:01,135 --> 00:01:03,920
 each with some feedback on how effectively they work.

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,385
 But as you can tell, we're not done yet. We don't have an app.

25
00:01:07,385 --> 00:01:07,385
 So, what's next? Next, we go through another iteration of the design lifecycle.
