1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,070
 So, that's the end, right?

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,390
 We went through a few iterations of the design lifecycle,

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,190
 we got iteratively more high-fidelity and rigorous with our evaluation.

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,215
 Finally, we have a design we like.

5
00:00:10,215 --> 00:00:11,385
 So, we implement it,

6
00:00:11,385 --> 00:00:16,455
 we submit it to the App Store and we sit back while the money roles in, not exactly.

7
00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:20,640
 Now instead of having a handful of users we bring in to use our interface,

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,835
 we have hundreds of users using it in ways we never expected,

9
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:25,950
 and now the cycle begins again.

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,330
 We have data we're automatically collecting through either usage tracking or error logs.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,060
 We have user reviews or the feedback that they submit.

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,190
 So we jumped back into need-finding using the data we now have available to us.

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,410
 We might find more subtle needs like

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,425
 the need for more control over rewinding and fast-forwarding.

15
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:44,810
 We might move on and prototype things like a command

16
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,260
 for back five seconds or back 15 seconds.

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,810
 We might uncover more novel new needs as well,

18
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,050
 we find that there might be

19
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,320
 a significant contingent of people using the interface while driving.

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,085
 It's similar in that it's another place where people's hands and eyes are occupied,

21
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:00,110
 but it has its own unique needs as well

22
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,965
 like the ability to run alongside a navigation app.

23
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:04,965
 So, the process starts again.

24
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:08,150
 This time with live users data and in general,

25
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,875
 it never really ends.

26
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:13,190
 Nowadays, you very rarely see interfaces or apps or programs or

27
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,245
 websites that are intentionally put up once and never changed.

28
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:20,950
 That might happen because designers got busy or the company went out of business,

29
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,065
 but it's rarely a one-off deployment by design.

30
00:01:24,065 --> 00:01:27,210
 As the design evolves over time with real data,

31
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,185
 you'll start to see some nested feedback cycles as well.

32
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:32,330
 Week to week small editions give way to

33
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,465
 month-to-month updates and year to year reinventions.

34
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:38,915
 In many ways, your interface becomes like a child.

35
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:40,400
 You watch it grow up,

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,400
 and take on a life of its own.
